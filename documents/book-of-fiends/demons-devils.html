As hostile and nasty as the Abyss can be, certain creatures do manage to eke out an existence here, as their natures parallel that of the Abyss itself. Th ese beings, commonly known as demons on the Material Plane, divide themselves into countless races, subraces, and breeds. Th e greatest demons bend the spirit of the plane itself to their will, becoming self-styled princes of certain layers, dominating hordes of demonic subjects just as human sovereigns com- mand their vassals.
</p>
<p id="page3p2" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Notoriously disloyal, demons hold true allegiance only to their own chaotic, unpredictable nature. Th ey war against one another, against the devils of the Nine Hells, and against the angelic choirs of the Upper Planes, sacri- fi cing themselves without regard for their own well-being as if honoring the very concept of destruction, whether of themselves or their enemies. Despite their propensity to die in huge numbers when facing better-organized foes, the uncountable horde propels the armies of the Abyss to victory as often as not. An in fi nite plane, after all, can produce an in fi nite number of demonic soldiers.

</p>
<p id="page3p4" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Outer Planes. Some delight in tempting mortals to acts of chaos and evil, increasing the number of souls entering the Abyss with every foul corruption. Demon princes require mortal souls to maintain their hold on their per- sonal layers, and their agents roam the physical world in search of converts for their infernal masters.
</p>
<p id="page3p5" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Some demons come to the Material Plane at the behest of amoral wizards, clerics, or sorcerers, who summon them from the Abyss to do their bidding. When under the command of a summoner, demons make powerful shock troops, cunning con fi dants, and skillful assassins. Certain magical practitioners, warlocks and wizards alike, have developed the practice of manipulating demonic forces and magic to a science. Just as the world has much to o ff er demons, demons have much to o ff er it.
</p>
<p id="page3p6" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Even an adherence to chaos and evil, however, allows room for di ff erences. Not all demons exist merely to frighten or eat mortals. Some can make for powerful (albeit very dangerous) allies, approaching an adventur- ing party with o ff ers of mutual assistance. Some portray themselves as misunderstood victims of creation, benevo- lent advocates of philosophies not intrinsically "bad," but simply frowned upon by society at large. In the magical world of a fantasy roleplaying campaign, knowing the di ff erence between a silk-voiced demon who legitimately o ff ers unknown pleasures and one who merely wants to feast on your innards is a valuable skill indeed.

Whether sent to track down and kill a demon who angered their masters or simply for their own amusement, alastors go where they wish, having free access to all places in the Abyss outside those dominions controlled by the demon lords and princes.

Although a number of speci fi c breeds of demons populate the Abyss, they represent but a fraction of what the chaotic evil plane creates. Many demons—some would argue most, in fact—pull themselves free of the muck, displaying a wide range of bizarre physical traits. Some possess animal features in unlikely combinations and positions across their misshapen bodies. Others might have bizarre char- acteristics and shapes, with some having enormous heads they must drag along the ground and others being heaps of slippery tentacles crowded around a slavering maw. Others still might look almost human but have some foul sign that gives away the truth about their wicked natures.
</p>
<p id="page12p28" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Rather than compartmentalizing these di ff ering breeds into their own strains, most demonologists just refer to them as horde demons, since they gather up in large mobs and crash about the Abyss to feed their appetite for chaos and destruction. Within the ranks of horde demons, there are three basic types di ff erentiated by size: least horde demons, lesser horde demons, and horde demons.

A target that has lost its soul in this way and dies cannot be restored to life by any means short of a wish spell.
A jahi can hold a single soul at any one time. Once it has done so, it becomes signi fi cantly more di ffi cult for it to operate in normal society. As the soul struggles fruitlessly to escape, it reaches for freedom so that impressions of its hands and face sometimes appear upon the jahi's belly.

A weak and feeble breed of demon, they would surely have died out had they not proven so useful as familiars. Plucked from the chaotic depths of the Abyss and bound to mortal masters, they toil as helpers, spies, and, sometimes, con fi dants. Th eir morose demeanor di ff erentiates mandragoras from the capricious and con- niving quasits with whom they compete, along with the mandragoras' boundless curiosity about the world and their environs. Th eir naturally inquisitive nature tends to land them in trouble, whether they court it or not.

A particularly devious mandragoras sometimes pretends to befriend a mortal, asking to hop upon its shoulder for a quick ride to a nearby destination. Once in transit, the mandrago- ras swiftly jabs its tails into its host's neck, cackling in a high-pitched voice as the mortal pitches to the ground, poisoned. Some mandragoras enjoy assuming doll forms when positioned in a treasure hoard, animating in a pack to rummage around and perhaps steal their kid- napper's possessions. Th ey always cut through the sack on their way out, hoping against hope that they've been placed in a bag of holding and that their tear will spill the bag's contents (including the mandragoras) into the

Th e goat-headed schirim pervade the Material Plane, primarily because they can be summoned by magic easily accessible to spellcasters with very little skill.

Mortal souls that have passed on to an Abyssal afterlife form an important currency in the Abyss, as demon princes covet the energy they contain. Demons in service to these princes scour the Howling Th reshold, the layer upon which souls manifest themselves after making the transition from life, gathering up souls for their wicked masters. Th e demons herd the souls together and force them through so-called Harvest Gates to the personal layers of princes, never to be seen again.

Soulkeepers are highly sought after by demon princes, who reward them handsomely for their important service.

In raven form, the demon a ff ects ravens and swarms of ravens. Each beast matching the xaiex's current form that starts its turn within 60 feet of the demon must succeed on a DC 14
Charisma saving throw or have its alignment change to chaotic evil.
While its alignment is chaotic evil, the a ff ected creature is friendly to the demon and obeys its mental commands. In addition, weapon attacks made by such creatures deal an additional 1d6 damage.

De mon Lor ds and Prince s
</p>
<p id="page33p3" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Each demonic breed contains numerous physical and mental variations. Th e most powerful transcend the lim- itations of their original forms to become demon lords or princes. It is unknown precisely how a "standard" demon becomes a lord, though energy derived from mortal souls seems to play an important role in the transformation.
Some lords prefer to retain vestiges of their original appearance, but many select a form without parallel in all of the underworld.
</p>
<p id="page33p4" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Less mysterious are the means by which a demon lord becomes a prince. Th rough arcane magic, warfare, and sheer force of will, some demon lords are able to "tame" a layer of the Abyss. Just as a god commands certain magical and mundane aspects of its home realm, so too can a demon prince shape and control the physical and metaphysical landscape of its personal domain. Th e great- est demon princes, such as Vaz'zht and Demogorgon, command more than one contiguous layer, though such empire building is extremely rare. Of the 666 cataloged layers of the Abyss, fewer than one-third have been so dominated. Another third form battlegrounds for would-be princes hoping to gain control, and the rest are so hazardous even the most appalling demon lords see little in them worth the trouble of conquest.
</p>
<p id="page33p5" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Dominating a layer of the Abyss brings with it a host of bene fi ts. Demon princes need not fear death outside their home plane. If slain on another plane, the demon's essence returns to its domain and is re-formed by the plane itself (usually in a familiar but somewhat di ff erent form) within six days. Th ereafter, it is barred from returning to the plane of its destruction for a hundred years. While a century might seem a long time for a human or even an elf, most demon princes are willing to bide their time, plotting revenge against their murderer's progeny. And, of course, they remain free to send minions or mortal wor- shippers against their hated enemies from afar.

Gat he ring Soul s
</p>
<p id="page33p7" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
A demon prince requires energy to bend a layer of the
Abyss to its will and maintain control over it, and it gains this energy from the souls of deceased mortals. Princes engage in two primary means of acquiring souls: sponsor- ing and harvesting.
</p>
<p id="page33p8" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Soul sponsoring involves making pacts with mortals.
In return for some service, the demon prince lays claim to a mortal's soul upon that being's death. Rather than the complicated contracts prepared by their diabolical kin, demons favor a simple approach. When a mortal calls out for a demon's aid, whether through thaumaturgic rituals (the usual method) or simple entreaties (a far less certain prospect), the prince gazes into the supplicant's heart. If the o ff er is in earnest, the bargain is accepted on the spot.
If not, the demon ignores it or sometimes punishes the mortal for wasting its time.
</p>
<p id="page33p9" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Not all souls fi nd their way into a demon prince's domain willingly. Th ough sponsored souls have especial succulence, the sovereigns of the Abyss gain some power from the destruction of souls harvested from the plane's uppermost layer. Agents of the demon princes, often powerful demon lords in their own right, scour the layer for newly arrived souls, who are "harvested" in great numbers and driven in packs through the many gates leading lower into the Abyss.
Th e screams of these tortured, hunted souls fi ll the layer's skies with a grim cacophony, giving the place its most common sobriquet: the Howling Th reshold.
</p>
<p id="page33p10" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Most souls given to demon princes are utterly destroyed and can never return to the world of the living (this process can take from a moment to several years' time, depending upon the disposition and methods of the prince in question). Some souls, however, achieve positions of power within a prince's hierarchy, acting as knowledge- able advisors or trusted guards. Some princes admire the souls of particularly devout followers or extremely debased individuals and allow them to exist for eternity. Others keep souls merely to provide entertainment in the form of tortured screams that never end. Many seem to make such determinations purely at random. For some mortals, living forever in the service of a demon prince is more exciting and alluring than mortal life ever could have been. Others receive only horri fi c tortures and so su ff er the fi nal justice that they eluded in life.

When the breeze stirs in the Abyss, one can sometimes catch a whi ff of Cresil in the air. So profound is his stink and that of his dominion that the odor of it sometimes reaches across the whole of the Abyss. Th e Lord of
Excess, Gourmand of Garbage, Prince of Rubbish, Sultan of Shit, Cresil the Impure rules over a layer crowded with the leavings of a million worlds, all heaped and rotting, the landscape groaning over stacks and piles of whatever foulness the demon lord has managed to collect.

<p id="page34p3" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
When not picking his way between the towering piles of garbage or sampling the o ff ensive stench of some bit of rot or fi lth, he can be found seated atop a hill of souls that have had the singular misfortune to fi nd themselves cast into his safekeeping. His prodigious weight crushes the pile, squeezing out the doomed so they gasp and wheeze with each shift of his ponderous bulk. He chortles at their misery, swinging his head bristling with thirteen horns that climb from the sticky mass of black hair this way and that to look down and mock his victims' su ff ering. As befouled as his domain, spoiled food, excrement, and even less savory sub- stances plaster his body, on

Cresil has little to do with other demon lords, shunned as he is for his base humor and low interests. Th us, he makes no e ff ort to contribute to the eternal war against
Hell or to embroil himself in the many machinations that turn demon lord against demon lord. Cresil seems content to pass the eons in the reeking mountains of his layer, expanding his in fl uence by adding to the piles whatever choice treasures he and his foul minions can fi nd.
</p>
<p id="page34p6" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Since Cresil's attention remains fi xed upon feeding his appetites and making his victims su ff er, he fi nds scant followers in the Material Plane. Th ose who might appre- ciate his singular focus are usually tempted away by other powers of the Abyss, such as the Lord of Many Forms and
Marbas. When mortals do seek out Cresil, for whatever insane reason they might, Cresil's interest in his servants is fl eeting at best, and when he does pay attention, he tends to see these individuals as playthings to torment by withhold- ing his favors or introducing fresh horrors to their lives and loved ones as some bizarre reward for their devotion.

A primal demon lord with no allegiance to power or prince, no territory to call his own, and no cause for which to fi ght, Eurynomus roams the Abyss, followed by a shrieking mob of ghouls. On a plane obsessed with souls, Eurynomus's taste runs to something di ff erent: fl esh.
</p>
<p id="page35p42" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Known as the Corpse Eater, Eurynomus has a voracious appetite for fl esh of all sorts. Nothing gives him more pleasure than sucking the meat o ff the bones of a freshly killed victim, a passion he shares with the ghouls that follow him. He is such a glutton, so the story goes, that he grew a second mouth in his belly so he could eat faster.
Whatever the truth of its origin, his horri fi c lower maw is legendary. It never speaks, moving only to eat or to lick its lips in anticipation of its next feeding.
</p>
<p id="page35p43" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Th e Corpse Eater does what he must to feed his addic-tion. He sometimes hires himself out to demon princes, though in truth he isn't a very reliable mercenary. He often visits the Material Plane to feed, and he especially enjoys traveling to worlds at war. Blasted battle fi elds, fi lled with the wounded and the dying, are places of beauty to Eurynomus. Men crying out for their mothers before the oblivion of death are like invitations to dinner for the Corpse Eater and his followers.
</p>
<p id="page35p44" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
In some lands graced by visits from Eurynomus, funer-ary customs changed quickly. Several temples have taken to cremating corpses instead of burying them, to better protect the honored dead from desecration.

A crooked tower made from rusting iron plates that bristle with hooks and barbs serves as Rahu's lair, and the sounds of screaming reach out through the jagged gaps and carry for miles around the blighted place. Rahu's dread in fl uence distorts the landscape around him, twist- ing it into a re fl ection of his cruelty and madness. Within the tower's con fi nes su ff er Rahu's victims, countless wretches pulled apart, torn, and racked by his fell min- istrations.

Torturers everywhere pray to the demon prince Azidahaka as patron of both truth and lies. Th ey're much more likely to respect his chief "surgeon," Rahu the Tormentor, though, as it is Rahu who frequently visits the Material Plane to evangelize the use of torture as a means of political control.

<p id="page41p4" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
A collector of both surgical instruments and preserved body parts, Rahu has an interest in human physiology and anatomy best categorized as obsessive. He tires of working under the paranoid Azidahaka, wasting his e ff orts upon demons and souls. He longs to fl ee to a mortal world, where he can continue his grim work with no shortage of live human victims.

Th e Tormentor speaks in a soothing, low voice that would put listeners at ease if it came from the mouth of anyone else.

Now, Philotanus lives two lives, one rampaging through the Abyss and the other sampling the delicious screams of the tormented in
Belial's fortress. Stranger still, both Belial and Socothben-oth know of the demon lord's treachery, but, for now at least, both abide his antics.

<p id="page41p10" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Philotanus stands nine feet tall, with fl awless features.
While he usually manifests in masculine form, it's a trivial thing for him to take the form of a breathtaking example of any gender, though all such shapes are unmistakably
Philotanus. He wears the fi nest clothing in the latest fashion and keeps his face dusted with white powder, with blue on his nose and cheeks. Normally, he conceals his horned head under a wig of golden locks, each strand taken from a mortal he has despoiled. Th e only clues to his wicked nature are the mouth fi lled with sharp, brown teeth and the squirming of worms in his gums.

If this is true, neither asakkus nor couatls have con fi rmed it. However, there are several battles documented between the two, most of which have been noted for their intense savagery. It isn't clear whether these battles signify nothing more than the animosity of good and evil or the special hatred only estranged family members know.

<p id="page46p21" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
In any case, fi ghting is not the primary responsibility of asakkus. Th ey perform very special duties for Lilith: the corruption and infection of mortal children. Th ey are frequent callers on the Material Plane, commonly visiting rural areas. Polymorphed into wide-eyed youths or fantastical animals like unicorns, asakkus befriend children while their parents toil in the fi eld or the home. Asakkus seem like friendly faeries, full of stories and magic.

<p id="page46p22" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Th ose children befriended by asakkus meet one of three fates. Th e asakkus drink their blood, infect them with lethal diseases, or corrupt their young souls. Th e latter is the most di ffi cult to achieve but pleases the asak- kus the most. When a child plunges a knife into their father's heart of their own free will, the asakku knows it has served its mistress well. Children who are good at heart are more likely to simply be killed. Th ese deaths, especially those brought about by disease, are designed to bring despair to the parents of the slain.
</p>
<p id="page46p23" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Asakkus are servants of Lilith, Lord of the Sixth Circle.
Th eir bodies are long and serpentine, with humanlike heads and fanged mouths. Mortal scholars have noted a certain similarity to the couatl, and conjecture makes asakkus ancient, evil o ff shoots of those feathery exemplars of virtue.

Cranial wretches are small corruptions of the cherubs, devoted servants to their master Asmodeus. Th ey travel in swarms through Hell, serving as messengers or spies all in service to the dark lord.

Th e primary purpose of these devils is to extract the memories, minds, and sins from the most wicked of mortals con- demned to an eternity in Hell. Th e cranial wretch latches on to the victim and spreads its sensual lips to suckle on the back of its prey's head. Th ough cranial wretches enjoy the fresh, bloody meat found within the skull, they exer- cise unbelievable restraint, selecting the choicest bits to savor as their victims live on to su ff er for eternity.

A distender's body is divided into four inner cham-bers, each of which produces one of the four classic humors: black bile, blood, phlegm, and yellow bile. It can regurgitate huge quantities of these fl uids, operat- ing as a sort of living artillery piece for infernal armies.
Th e humors' e ff ects are especially potent on the Material
Plane, and even one distender can carry a battle for the forces of evil. Infernal agents and minions thus frequently summon them.

Moving up in the caste system of Hell is an arduous task.
It can take thousands of years of loyal service, an act of sacri fi ce, or seizing on a unique opportunity—one that may never come. While there are many devils who are willing to adhere to the rules of society, others prefer the code of the silent knife. It is these power-hungry fi ends who call upon the faceless.
</p>
<p id="page57p25" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Th e faceless are a society of cutthroats who make their services available to anyone willing to pay the price. Th at price is souls. Upon successfully completing an assign- ment, the killer returns to its employer wearing the proof of its success—the face of its target.
</p>
<p id="page57p26" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
No one knows for certain where in Hell the faceless reside. Devils who wish to hire a member of this secret society must communicate through intermediaries who, if the job is accepted, relate the price to be paid (based strictly upon the target's station). Th ere is no further com- munication until the assassination is attempted.
</p>
<p id="page57p27" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
A number of strict guidelines bind each member of the faceless. Th ey are never to kill unless they have been spe- ci fi cally given a target. Th ey can never take assignments other than those given to them by their superiors. A target is assigned one faceless, who must succeed in that mission or die trying. If an assassination fails, the fee is returned.
In addition, the former target has the right to hire one of the faceless to kill the original employer—free of charge.

If Duke Furcas has a weakness, it's that he craves recog-nition for his genius. It is not enough for him to outsmart a foe; he must make sure that the deed is publicized. Even his books, written under pen names, contain complicated ciphers that reveal the true author to those smart enough to fi gure it out. His thirst for accolades has gotten him into trouble in the past. Dispater pierced his body with iron rings and hung Furcas from his tower for a year after a particularly notorious incident. Furcas has kept the rings in his body as a sign of obeisance.

Furcas's greatest rival in Hell is Bune, Duke of Eloquence
(see Bune, later in this chapter). Both devils use honeyed words as weapons, but Furcas's rhetoric is backed up with knowledge. His arguments are based on fact and logic, while
Bune's manipulate the psyche. Th ey have never confronted each other directly, instead preferring to play a great game down through the centuries. Th e dukes try to prove their mastery by converting each other's minions. Both courts are riddled with double agents, and only intellects such as theirs can keep track of where true loyalties lie. Neither Furcas nor
Bune misses an opportunity to show up his rival.

Duchess Hadriel is an infernal success story. She began as an erinyes who, through long service, shrewd politics, and well-timed betrayals, rose up through the devil hierarchy.
She eventually won a place at the court of Mephistopheles and felt she had truly arrived in devil society. With the prestige and resources that were now hers, she believed her power could only increase. What Hadriel had not reckoned with was Mephistopheles himself. Th e Lord of the Eighth Circle was known as a devil of the old school.
He still considered fallen celestials like Beelzebub to be upstarts, and Hadriel discovered that female nobles in the court of Mephistopheles could aspire to nothing more

Hadriel did not make it to Mephistopheles's court by being stupid, so she swallowed her pride and played the part until an opportunity arose. She became the consort of Duke Bifrons, a brutish general who spent much of his time in the fi eld. Hadriel spent the better part of a cen- tury building up a cadre of loyal minions and then struck.
Bifrons had an "accident" while on campaign, an obsidian dagger somehow ending up in his heart. Hadriel took over so quickly no one thought to question it.

Th is maneuver solved Hadriel's immediate problem, but

Hellwardens are an ingenious creation of Baal, Lord of the First Circle. More fi ghting goes on in Baal's domain than anywhere else in Hell: Th ere the devilish legions have fought demons, celestials, and one another uncountable times. In fact, war is so frequent that piles of corpses, fi elds of bones, and forests of the cruci fi ed are common sights.
Baal made the Hellwardens to take advantage of this ter-rain, giving himself an easily camou fl aged spy network.
</p>
<p id="page65p22" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Hellwardens look like horribly cruci fi ed devils, often with missing limbs and gaping wounds. Although they appear quite dead, powerful magic keeps them alive. Baal and his commanders plant these spies throughout the First
Circle to collect intelligence on their enemies. Hellwardens are sometimes used to guard fortresses and encampments as well, since their piercing scream makes an excellent alarm.
</p>
<p id="page65p23" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Hellwardens are occasionally seen on the Material Plane, but only during particularly brutal wars or pogroms.
</p>
<p id="page65p24" lang="en" fontname="PFPIWB+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Hellwardens are not fi ghters: their job is to collect information, not attack the enemy. Occasionally, though, they are used to ambush enemy columns. When gathered in numbers, they can be quite formidable. Hellwardens use their magic to keep their distance in combat while they attack with their other spells.

Hell recognizes the di ff erences between souls that walk through its iron gates. Most of the damned face transfor- mation into manes, devils situated at the very bottom of the plane's hierarchy. In time they might ascend to higher posi- tions, earning new bodies to match, but most just languish among the lowly. However, when a soul belonging to a great tyrant, brutal warlord, or despicable despot fi nds its way to Hell, it is set aside, its fate much di ff erent. Th ese souls become infernal beacons for the devils on the battle fi elds, transformed into towering fi gures tasked with leading the charge against Hell's enemies.

Despite their lowly status, knockers are not uncommon visitors to the Material Plane. Petty wizards sometimes summon them, but more frequently knockers stumble through an underground portal and leave Hell before they realize it. Once on the Material Plane, they delight in making mischief. After toiling for countless hours in Hell, these visits are almost like vacations to them.

One would think that knockers would have some sym-pathy for mortal miners, but the opposite is true.

Lilith, the ruler of the Sixth Circle, is one of the most notorious seductresses in the multiverse. But when Lilith encounters someone too smart, pure, or strong-willed to fall for even her legendary powers, she calls on Lel, Mar- quise of the Night.

Lel is a favored minion of Lilith, a specialist in the dark arts of blackmail and murder. She is a valuable tool in the politics of Hell, but she is priceless on the Material Plane.
Very few mortals have what it takes to survive Lel's atten-tions. Rumors in the infernal courts ascribe her special powers to godly blood, and some whisper that she is the result of a tryst between Lilith and Anshar, the Babylo- nian god of night. Raising such a child would be quite a feat, considering that Lilith's breasts produce poison instead of milk, but that doesn't stop the gossip.

A powerful noble of the First Circle of Hell, Malgrin tries to curry favor with Lord Baal by winning military victories and has chosen a novel way to do so. Most armies on the First Circle are composed, naturally enough, of devils. Th ey are in near-constant con fl ict with their perpetual enemies, demons, but also face internal threats. Devils are simply too interested in their own advancement to make trustworthy subordinates. Malgrin should know—he rose to his position by assassinating his former boss. Once in charge, he decided to secure his position by increasing the undead forces under his com- mand. Th ere were plenty of corpses to make troops from, and he found their obedience pleasing. Moreover, his fi endish skeletons cannot be turned while in Hell. Now known as the Duke of Unlife, Malgrin has a huge undead horde under his command. His o ffi cers are not devils at all, but necromancers of various races who have pledged themselves to him. Th e implacable advance of the duke's legions has routed both demons and rival devils.

Th roughout the endless acts of debauchery, the selidim feed on the pain, experiencing awful pleasure that leaves them writhing and gasping on their thrones.
To heighten their experience, they pierce their fl esh with barbed hooks, fl ay their backs with scourges, and tear strips of skin from their bodies, letting the blood fl ow. Th e greater the pain, the greater the pleasure, until the selidim fi nally have enough and slaughter the gathered thralls.

Sometimes confused with the helpful and benevolent faeries found in the mortal world and the realms of the fey folk, spites share nothing more than their appearance with these good-hearted folks. Cruel and wicked, spites aid mortals to make easier their labors. Mortals who agree fi nd the spites work quickly and expertly, faster than anyone could ever hope to achieve. Upon comple- tion of their work, however, the spites demand payment, which normally takes the form of a human child. If the mortal provides the child, the demons spirit it away to
Hell, where, through depraved rituals, they transform the child into another spite. If the mortal refuses to give up the child, the spites undo everything they have done and take the mortal's nose for calling them heedlessly.
