This book also gives players the rules they need to take up arms and spells on behalf of these dark masters, to fight in the name of all that is evil in the vain hope of earning pride of place when death finally comes to claim them. This book brings the darkness to your 5th edition games in ways few other books dare.

If you've been around for a few editions of the world's most popular roleplaying game, you probably recall the heady days of the early 2000s, when everyone and their uncle was producing content for the 3rd edition rules thanks to the Open Game
License. This era launched the careers of many game designers, as publishers were always in need of writers to meet the incredible demand for supplements and sourcebooks. It was during this time that Green Ronin released two darkly alluring tomes—Legions of Hell by Chris Pramas and Armies of the Abyss by Erik Mona. These two books took the usual suspects found in Hell and the Abyss and made them come to life, offering hints about their long, perverse histories and the various powers jockeying for dominance in those planes. Together, the books transformed these realms into truly terrifying places populated with creatures nasty enough to give even the most jaded adventurer pause.
</p>
<p id="page5p7" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Not long after, Green Ronin released Aaron Loeb's The Book of the Righteous, a glorious tome loaded with lore and details of an entirely new pantheon of gods. With it, according to Pramas, was to be a third volume on the fiends, a book entitled Hordes

books released so far and plugged directly into the cosmology introduced in The Book of the Righteous. While all this was going on, I was working hard to get my foot in the door of the gaming industry and sent in a pitch to write a book on antipaladins.
Since the holy warrior received treatment in The Book of the Righteous, and since Chris Pramas is such a great guy, he gave me a shot. A year later, The Unholy Warrior's Handbook hit the shelves.
</p>
<p id="page5p10" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Now the appearance of the original Book of Fiends had a lot to do with the rules update known as the 3.5 edition.
Although you could play with material published for 3rd edition using the 3.5 rules, there were differences enough that people started asking for updated copies of Legions of Hell and Armies of the Abyss. Rather than re-release these supplements, Green Ronin opted to bundle them with the Hordes of Gehenna book and chunks of the Unholy Warrior book, while updat- ing all the material on demons and devils in one grand tome. To my delight and surprise, I was asked to come on board and help design the daemons for the Gehenna chapter and add a few demons and devils to their respective chapters.
</p>
<p id="page5p11" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Italic">
The Book of Fiends was a great success when it was released and won all sorts of acclaim for its sinister contents. In fact, it
</p>
<p id="page5p12" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
even went on to win an ENnie Award or two. The book's success prompted us to start working on follow-up releases, which would have been called The Book of the Wicked and Lords of the Fiends. A variety of factors, however, conspired to put bullets into the heads of both of these titles, and the line more or less stopped here.
</p>
<p id="page5p13" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Well, flash forward some fifteen years, and here I am revisiting work from the earliest days of my career and writing this happy introduction. After the success of The Book of the Righteous Kickstarter campaign for a 5th edition update to that beloved book, it seemed like a no-brainer to resurrect The Book of Fiends. Over a phone call, Chris and I hammered out the basics of this product, figuring out just what would be involved in bringing this book back to life. Once we sorted the details, I dove into the old manu- scripts. Rather than divide this book along planar lines, I changed the structure so that readers would be able to enter the planes, examine their denizens, and then, if they wanted, serve them with new options for player characters. I rebuilt each monster from the ground up, drawing on my extensive experience as a designer of the 5th edition rules, and checked and double-checked everything to ensure the creatures presented would prove suitable foes for adventurers of all levels. With the aid of playtesters and the developer, this book came together, and here we are.
</p>
<p id="page5p14" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
It was weird as hell going back to my work from what feels like another lifetime, but it's been a delight to get in the mud, blood, and filth to construct a menagerie of despicable critters to unleash upon the world. While I did loads of mechanical work, many of the original ideas remain, which just goes to show what a great design team was on the original. So, thanks to everyone, past and present, who helped pull this beast together, thanks to Chris and the Ronins for welcoming me back into the family for this project, and thanks to you for embracing your inner darkness. Hail!

Though soul forms make up the majority of the Howl-ing Threshold's populace, the place is rightly feared for its demonic inhabitants. Millions of demons fly its turbid skies and roam its vast plains. Most of these creatures serve no master, feasting upon souls simply because it gives them pleasure to do so. Countless demons live out near-immortal life spans with goals no more complicated than killing, eating, and fornicating. Thousands of demon lords live in vaunted fortresses spaced irregularly through- out the layer, commanding infernal armies in their quest to corrupt the mortal world or establish themselves as princes in the lower Abyss. These beings include the diseased Ahazu the Seizer, calculating Aldinach of the
Thirty-Three Terrors, desiccated Baltazo the Pitiless, and the errant lord Laraie of the Unerring Bow.

In addition to independent demon lords, unique, pow-erful nobles in service to demon princes roam the plains of the Howling Threshold, seeking captives for their dread masters. These beings, and the countless servitor creatures that aid them, gather huge groups of souls, prodding them toward the conduits leading to the realms below. These portals are heavily fortified for miles around and are known as Harvest Gates by demons and souls alike. Few captives thrust into these grim passages ever emerge to tell the tale of their travels. Some Harvest Gates lead to the per- sonal domains of demon princes such as Demogorgon or
Abraxas, but just as many open to vistas of indescribable

Many are inspired by such a reward to live virtuous lives and show fear and adoration to the gods, knowing one day they will ascend with the angels and be reunited with lost loved ones in a place of infinite peace and beauty. With a reward like this in the offering, it's a wonder anyone would do anything but give their life toward attaining the ultimate reward.

Yet people do reject the gods all the time. They set aside their misgivings about what comes after to indulge their desires, vices, and wickedness. The greater their sins against the gods, the faster their descent into evil. And when death finally comes for them, these souls find the gates of Heaven closed to them and themselves slowly sinking to the Planes of Perdi- tion, where they must make an account of their mortal misdeeds and suffer the consequences of their failings for all time.

Three destinations await the damned, each one suited to the soul's alignment. Those of chaotic evil alignment tumble into the endless depths of the Abyss, home of the demons. Lawful evil souls are drawn into Hell, where they must suffer torments from the devils who dwell there.

Some scholars believe everything in the material world is but a representation of some intrinsically pure concept found in the Outer Planes. A castle, for example, is an echo of a perfect archetypal castle that exists somewhere beyond the Astral Plane. The existence of the roiling
Abyss lends credence to such theories. The seemingly infinite layers of this plane of chaos and evil house the perfect inspiration for countless acts of murder, betrayal, perversion, and decadence.

Whole cities rise and fall at the whims of distant masters, in endless cycles that seem only to prove the inevitability of anarchy and decay. The aimless souls of mortals range from layer to layer, fearing capture from nigh-omnipotent lords eager to suck essence from their metaphysical marrow. Landscapes leach life, color, and nutrients from those who attempt to settle them, and wild beasts controlled only by hunger and lust haunt jungles infested with murderous plants and poisonous streams.
Few foreigners survive long in the Abyss. The plane seems to be designed by a bickering assembly of insane, but nonetheless brilliant, architects for the sole purpose of punishing and destroying its inhabitants.

The ancient city was built by the qlippoth—a terrible breed who claimed the Abyss prior to the arrival of the demons—but was abandoned at the height of the war against the celestials. Now, demons avoid the city and its extensive dungeons, which occasionally belch forth eons- old horrors that savage any foolish enough to let down their guards for even a moment. Because most Abyssal creatures shun it, Amalrehtan has become a haven for travelers from other planes, including the Material, and rumors tell of great marketplaces filled with transplanar lore and treasure unavailable anywhere else in the multiverse.

Nowhere is it more apparent that evil has many forms than in the lower realms of the Abyss. Some layers present alien landscapes rife with malevolent vegetation and even more harmful inhabitants. Others contain no atmosphere or air crackling with poisonous fire that consumes all who breathe it. Certain layers seem to be sentient creatures in and of themselves.

Simply choosing a gate at random and wandering to some unknown lower layer is as good a form of suicide as any available across the Outer Planes. Ironically, the safest layers are often those dominated by a particular demon prince, as these nobles must force their realms to be hos- pitable enough for their legions of demonic followers and soul-form chattel.

Demon princes command at least one third of the 666
recorded layers of the infinite Abyss. Princes in the Machi-avellian sense, they answer to no demonic ruler. Over the millennia, several have conquered enough Abyssal real estate or swayed the affections of enough of their kin to claim dominion over all of demonkind (the most recent being Demogorgon, who still holds his self-proclaimed title). The greatest and best-known demon princes com- mand the respect of their peers through brute force, skillful negotiation, or the ability to unleash sheer, unimaginable terror. Such princes include the legendary Orcus, brooding
Pazuzu, scheming Arachnadia, and the unnamable Lord of Many Forms. Students of the Abyssal arts know of resources in existing tomes or librams yet to come regarding these famous beings. The present volume concentrates on entities less well known but no less dangerous.

<p id="page8p9" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The following entries detail twenty-one demon princes, each providing notes on their subject's appearance, moti- vations, and Abyssal dominions. Each description opens with the name most commonly associated with the entity in question. This isn't the being's "true" secret name but rather its most commonly used moniker. (In nearly all cases, this is the name by which the being refers to itself.)
Danger comes in speaking even the common name of a demon prince. At the GM's discretion, speaking the name of a demon prince aloud elicits a cumulative 1 percent chance that the named demon prince will take notice of the speaker. This doesn't mean it'll act, or even act in the speaker's best interest, but if not otherwise indisposed, the entity might take a peek into the Material Plane to see what's going on. For this reason, most of the known demon princes have descriptive titles, such as Lord of the
Bottomless Pit, Diabolus, and so on. It is considered an ill omen to speak or write the names of demon princes, and those who do not rely upon these titles when discussing them are seen as dangerous fools by the learned.

Consequently, they do not always follow modern standards of morality, though attempts have been made to moderate certain antiquated ideas with modern sensibilities. The GM should review the material herein and change what they like to ensure it conforms to the nature of evil in their campaigns. Furthermore, since both ancient and modern notions of evil are concerned with violence and sexuality, be warned that images and scenarios concerning such can be found throughout.
Second, the existence of this explicit subject matter in no way condones the potentially disturbing and disgusting contents found herein. This book is about evil beings who deserve contempt and whose plots should be thwarted by good characters.
Therefore, this is not a book to use straight from the shelf. To utilize this book's explicit elements, you must receive consent from all players. If even one objects to their use, you should change or remove what bothers them. Furthermore, this consent can be withdrawn at any time. Players withdrawing their consent never need to defend or even explain their decision, and the GM should modify what they have presented without argument. Even if you use these and other safety tools, this does not remove the obligation to have a frank discussion, where all players feel safe expressing their opinions, about what they do and don't want from The Book of Fiends. Consider this a rule that applies throughout, as firmly as any that invokes dice rolls and game statistics.

Rumors suggest that the rent formed in the earliest days of the qlippoth-celestial conflict, when some unknowable horror unleashed by the plane's original mas- ters backfired and tore a hole in the Abyss. Eventually, the plane fused its own infernal energy with the null- space in the void, in a sense "adopting" its own wound as a full-blown Abyssal layer.

Students of the occult arts know Abaddon as one of the oldest demons, a being of such incalculable power that even his demonic contemporaries work to ensure that he never leaves his home layer, a chill- ing void known simply as the Bottomless
Pit. Abaddon is destruction personi-fied, a completely amoral, unfeeling agent of calamity who has a hand in most of the great natural catastro- phes of the mortal realm. While Anarazel gives violent life to the cold ground in the form of terrible earthquakes, and Vepar encourages great floods and waves, learned occultists see the grim smile of Abaddon in the corpses left after these tragedies. His handiwork reveals itself in the famines and blights following natural disasters. Though his insectoid legions thrum with demonic blood, few doubt
Abaddon's dominion over ordinary locusts and grasshop-pers, who honor him by plaguing crops in a metaphorical mirror of the destruction that soon will be visited upon the world. In some lands, Abaddon is known as Apollyon.

Gulthrax maintains its own gravity and sense of stabil-ity, though it constantly spins and bounces off the layer's walls. The fortress contains a large variety of demons, most of whom look forward to the end-time with utter devotion to their liege. Locust demons dominate nearly every part of the shaft—seldom will a traveler falling or flying down the Bottomless Pit come across a spot where they cannot see at least a dozen of the creatures. Perhaps a hundred brave vrocks fly throughout the chasm,

Mortal followers of Abaddon generally believe that the apocalypse will occur within their lifetimes and go about fomenting anarchy and unrest in an attempt to speed along the decay of the world. End-time-obsessed nihilists, cultists, and especially thaumaturges of Abaddon believe by doing the work of the Minister of Death and Havoc, they will be spared the consuming fury of the coming locust legions. Not all who follow Abaddon do so with such calculation, however. Common among those who honor him is the competitive farmer who, coveting the harvest of their neighbor, sends a small sacrifice to Abad- don to befoul the greater crop.

Abraxas represents a rarity among demon princes in that his devotees are tolerated, if not altogether welcomed, in civilized lands throughout the mortal world. Commoners and nobles alike honor Abraxas for his ability to protect them from ill luck and magical curses and hexes.
</p>
<p id="page10p7" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Followers of Abraxas fund their cult by selling medal-lions enchanted with the word "Abracadabra," talismans that guard their wearers against all manner of calamities.
Abraxans claim that the gods are evil beings who have trapped the souls of their mortal followers in all-too-frag- ile physical shells, isolating them from a world of absolute spirit (known as Pleroma), where joy is boundless and there are no limits to the pleasure and indulgence experi- enced by all. The concept of harm does not exist in such a world, and it is from this absolute, Abraxans claim, that their trinkets and amulets draw their protective powers.
</p>
<p id="page10p8" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Whatever the source, the charms work. The word of power "Abracadabra" appears at the top and is written in an inverted triangle of eleven lines. Each line consists of one letter fewer than the one above it, until the word dis- appears completely. The shrinking of the word represents, in metaphysical terms, the fading of potential harm to the wearer. The wordplay is emblematic of most of the teach- ings of Abraxas, which consist of intense magical theory and complex numerological formulae meant to give the practitioner a greater understanding of the material world and how to manipulate it through arcane magic.
</p>
<p id="page10p9" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Abraxas appears as a powerful, bare-chested humanoid man with the head of a rooster topped by an elaborate golden crown (which, according to his followers, rep- resents the reward of Pleroma, in which everyone is king).
He carries a shield in one hand and a long corded leather whip in the other. Below the waist, his body consists of several constantly writhing snakes.
</p>
<p id="page10p10" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Abraxas's Abyssal realm, Pleroma, is very much as advertised in his cult's literature. There, souls are trans- formed into beings of light who experience nothing but pure pleasure and ecstasy. Boundless joy is theirs from

the moment they enter the afterlife to the moment ten years later when they are completely consumed by bliss—their souls utterly annihilated and absorbed into the landscape of the Abyss. By the time souls enslaved to Pleromatic rapture realize the terminality of their sit- uation, they've long since surrendered the ability to do anything about it in exchange for greater and greater feel- ings of euphoria. The transaction fuels Abraxas's power, which appears to grow stronger with each passing year.

Abraxans believe that the only way to achieve entry to
Pleroma is to escape their mortal shells by living a life opposite to that which should have been theirs but for the duplicity of the gods. By denying themselves the pleasures of the flesh and leading austere, faultless lives, they hope to "trick" their containers (bodies) into releasing their spirit forms. Once free, their souls transcend the material world and enter the endless pleasures promised to them by the Supreme Unknown.
</p>
<p id="page10p13" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Riddled with highly offensive condemnations of even the most apparently altruistic deities, the cult's doctrine wins few allies among the clergy of the civilized world.
However, followers of Abraxas don't physically hurt anyone, are as chaste as the most devout nuns of the god of healing, and sell amulets of proven protective value, so most rulers view the cult as a strange but harmless sect more worthy of praise than prosecution.
</p>
<p id="page10p14" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The plain lifestyle espoused by Abraxans appeals to commoners who disapprove of lewd behavior but secretly wish to debauch themselves in the obscenest manners imaginable. Lacking the courage to do so in life, they instead punish themselves with self-denial and self-abuse, withholding from themselves in life exactly the types of pleasures they hope to indulge in after death. Flagellation plays a significant role in the cult's observances. Many pursue formal study of occult tomes to further explore arcane magic, which they interpret as the mortal world's sole tie to the realm of Pleroma. Abraxans determine for themselves when they have finally tricked their body-pris- ons into releasing their spirit forms, in a journey of flesh-rending, ultimately fatal ascetic self-torment.

The earth below your feet holds wondrous treasures just waiting to be claimed by those with the courage to take them. Ancient, long-dead cultures tunneled beneath the ground when the world was young, scattering the riches of entire races in forlorn caves and mines. Natural veins of precious metals and countless gems and minerals line the world's strata. But those caverns hold unthinkable terror as well, time-lost beings too dangerous for the world of light and unfathomable remnants of primordial cultures now sunken in morose insanity. Those who would gain the riches of the earth must also brave the evils of the world below, the servants of Anarazel who await explorers with gnashing teeth and terrible, clasping claws. Those who risk Anarazel's wrath and escape with the plunder of the earth are rich indeed.

Anarazel represents the duality of the unknowable hor-rors of the Underdark and those who face such terrors in search of excitement or material wealth. Devotees refer to the arrangement as "the thrill," a constant tempting of the depths for just one more gem, for another frisson of terror that much more exciting than the one before. To Anarazel and his followers, the abandoned underground cities and cisterns and mineral-rich caverns of the Underdark repre- sent a great game board where risks are measured against possible rewards, with the advantage always going to those who tempt fate a little further than their peers. Adventur- ers, unsurprisingly, make up the bulk of his clergy.

Anarazel's lair, a sprawling underground complex of natural caverns and trap-filled corridors called the Caves of Chaos, is thought by many to comprise the most extensive dungeon works in the Lower Planes. Cult lore reports that a copy of every valuable ever sacrificed in the demon prince's name can be found within Anarazel's dungeons. Countless artifacts long thought destroyed are in fact secreted within the caves, protected by a host of grotesque creatures born in the most wretched bowels of the lightless Underdark. The most honored souls sworn to Anarazel—those who died while seeking treasure underground without an ounce of fear in their hearts— are transformed into such guardians. Unworthy souls or those captured on the Howling Threshold are brought to
Anarazel himself, who dwells at the center of the layer.
There the Guardian of a Thousand Terrors reveals his true face to them, drawing strength from their horror in a metaphysical transaction that leaves Anarazel more pow- erful and utterly destroys the souls.

In the mortal world, Anarazel is served by the demon lords Gaziel and Fécor, who cause earthquakes, ring bells at midnight, cause specters to appear, and inspire countless terrors. Though he is honored by miners and prospectors, adventurers make up Anarazel's greatest constituency.
His philosophy of life as little more than a game appeals to those who seek vast rewards in exchange for great risk.
Anarazelite adventurers tend toward brashness and favor spells or items that induce fear in others, partially to con-

Knowledge separates humans from the animals, allowing them to reflect upon their status and, using the lessons of those who came before, improve upon it.
Astaroth personifies the philosophy of knowledge gained at any cost. The demon prince known as Diabolus is the patron of revolutionary thinkers and those willing to push against the forces of propriety and the status quo to break into truly innovative paths of thought. He discounts the "hard" sciences as too rigid to accommodate original con- cepts. Astaroth also has become associated with prophecy, though his philosophy is more about consulting written lore and making a prediction based upon the past than peering into the unknowable future.

<p id="page11p10" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Like Abaddon, Astaroth's purpose is tied to the coming multiversal apocalypse. Since the rise of the demons, he has collected all the written works of human- ity; ritual burning of the accumulated lore will herald the beginning of the end-time. In the meantime, Astaroth has become extremely fond of his collection, priding himself on the completeness of his libraries and his ability to recall historical facts and human philosophies from memory. Though dedicated to the role he must eventu- ally play, the great librarian is in no hurry to destroy his books—he's even become so fond of some human scholars and philosophers that he tracked them down and brought them to his lair (willing or not) to engage in friendly

His natural form is that of a beautiful angel astride a terrible dragon. He carries a viper in his right hand and usually reads from an open book held in his left. The snake represents knowledge gained through forbidden means, which Astaroth considers the most valuable of all.
Knowledge protected by religious taboos and strictures must, after all, be more worth knowing than what is sit- ting around for everyone to devour.

<p id="page12p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The Terminal Archive, Astaroth's sprawling library, forms the entirety of an always-expanding Abyssal layer.
The place comprises countless wings, which contain a copy of every written work put to paper since the birth of mortals and are staffed by an army of wretched, undead librarians. Astaroth invites any and all to study within his halls, naming the Archive as neutral ground in any conflict between demons. Remarkably, he even allows devils access to his collection, though few brave the journey to get there.
</p>
<p id="page12p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Occasionally battles between rivals do break out, but these are quickly quelled by a cadre of nalfeshnee called the
Ardent Archivists, who maintain order in the stacks. Given the relative peace offered by the Archive, many expect to find a given item easily. Unfortunately, Astaroth enforces no organization upon his collection at all, so finding a par- ticular volume can be an adventure in itself.
</p>
<p id="page12p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Followers of Astaroth fancy themselves revolutionary thinkers. Many do in fact push forward the liberal sciences by challenging conventions and daring to dream without worrying about such limits as morality. Even more, though, are best classified as lunatics, "visionaries" only in the sense that they believe their insane (albeit generally well-in- formed) babblings mean something to anyone other than themselves. Those who honor Diabolus will do anything to learn previously unknown lore. They'll use anyone, even friends and relatives, to further their own knowledge, and they won't hesitate to kill whoever stands in the way of some juicy bit of information. Astaroth demands that his followers sacrifice their firstborn child to him to prove their dedication to casting away even their most cherished pos- sessions in the pursuit of learning.

The doctrine of Azazel holds that every suc-cessful civilization is built upon the broken backs of the betrayed. Society itself is inherently corrupt: Some must suffer so that others can seat themselves upon the throne of propriety. To make things right, the high and mighty must be overthrown by those they have betrayed. Only when the lowly have tasted the blood of the powerful will the world be healed.

<p id="page12p7" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Such words, spoken by Azazelite demagogues, are wickedly crafted to lure the downtrodden members of the lower classes, as well as to prisoners, exiles, or others who have unfairly felt the lash of the law, away from constructive revolutions and just reforms into scorched, hate-poisoned chaos. Ranging from violent rebels to quietly dissatisfied servants, followers of Azazel work to thwart the plans of the privileged classes through cal- culated campaigns of larceny, arson, and murder. His followers do not spare rival agitators and insurgencies, however. Azazelites are practiced entryists, skilled at joining virtuous movements and twisting them to evil ends that spawn not reform, but a new class of oppressors.

Prior to passing on to the Abyss in death, few followers of Azazel know what awaits them in the afterlife. Most prefer to focus on the here and now, their blood boiling with thoughts of revenge for slights both real and imag- ined. Nobles and those who have dedicated their lives to preserving the law hate and fear the cult of Azazel, though the demon enjoys great popularity among vig- ilantes, who often see themselves as protectors of the downtrodden. Though Azazelites preach a doctrine many in the lower classes find attractive, their methods are so brutal, so unthinkably ruthless, only the most heartless stay with the cult for long.

Eons ago, not long after the solar Iblis fell from the Seven
Heavens for refusing to serve mortals (for more informa-tion, see Iblis on page 189), a fierce king named Zohak ruled one of the most prominent early human kingdoms.
Once a powerful and chaste noble who served the Lords of Good as a paragon of truth, Zohak achieved his posi- tion after murdering his predecessor, Jamshid, who had become so corrupt with power he forced his subjects to worship him as a god. Despite his greatness, Zohak knew he would not be able to defeat the god-king alone.
Instead, he employed the mighty Iblis, who granted him the service of an army of divs, fire-based outsiders who had inhabited the world prior to the rise of humanity but had been cast out by the Lords of Good for their arro- gance. Zohak gained the throne and freed his people from the tyranny of Jamshid, but at a terrible cost.
</p>
<p id="page13p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Iblis planted a seed of paranoia within his ally's heart.
Shortly after becoming king, Zohak came to believe that his subjects secretly schemed against him. Whereas the king had previously sworn himself to defend the truth, now he attempted to wrest it from the hearts of his assumed enemies by subjecting them to gruesome tor- tures. Unsurprisingly, these tortures brought more and more confessions, confirming Zohak's fears and fueling more seizures of enemies and greater and more perverse means of getting the truth from them. Within two years, Zohak's fears had manifested in the form of twin snakes growing from his shoulders. These terrible beasts kept
Zohak alive through the singular means of devouring the brains of his victims. Finally beset by enemies on all sides (enemies he had created thanks to his vicious pogroms), Zohak realized he had been betrayed the moment he joined forces with Iblis. Shamed, broken, and alone, Zohak hung himself from his castle's highest tower. His name went down in the lore of his people as a watchword for the corrupting influence of power.

chance, he took the name Azidahaka and vowed to create in the Abyss that which he could not maintain in the mate- rial world—a kingdom of subjects who honored him for his character and dedication to truth. Eventually, he became a demon. Centuries later, he wrested a layer of the Abyss for himself (Sraosha, a term meaning "obedience," or "disci- pline") and set his plans into motion. The Abyss being the
Abyss, however, he came up somewhat short of his goal.
</p>
<p id="page13p9" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Sraosha boasts as many traitors and schemers as his human kingdom ever did, but as Azidahaka's current sub- jects are demons and the souls of the chaotic evil dead, the dangers posed by his enemies are a thousand times greater than they were on the Material Plane. To protect his rulership, he's again turned to torture—indeed, the layer seems dedicated to perfecting that ancient art. Souls and demons alike hang on great metal hooks from the king- dom's parapets. Body parts and unidentifiable fluids stain the cobblestones of great cities, and countless screams issue forth from innumerable chambers filled with racks, brazen bulls, iron maidens, and worse.
</p>
<p id="page13p10" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Such perfection has brought with it the respect of mortal torturers the world over, as well as (ironically) pleas of guidance from those about to go under the torturer's knife. Both tormentor and tormented are equally likely to pray to Azidahaka—one for the skill to extract the truth, and the other in hopes of easing inevitable pain.
</p>
<p id="page13p11" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Azidahaka appears much as he did in life. A regal war-rior of handsome (if worry-worn) features, the so-called
Dragon of the Lie decks himself in the finest garments of royalty. Blood and ichor stain his vestments, however, revealing the means to which he must resort, to which he has always had to resort, to maintain his tenuous grasp on power and status. The only being Azidahaka truly trusts is his head torturer, the demon lord Rahu the
Tormentor, who seems tailor-made for the nightmarish parody that is the kingdom of Sraosha. Azidahaka's heart still burns for revenge against the traitorous liar Iblis, whom he has sworn to put to the blade in payment for his ancient betrayal.

If the archdevil Leviathan (see Leviathan on page 29
for more information) represents the most powerful sea creature the multiverse has ever known, the imposing
Behemoth stands as its land-dwelling double. A creature of immense proportions, Behemoth represents the worst qualities of the mortal creatures that walk upon the earth: ferocity, rage, sloth, and, most of all, insatiable hunger.
</p>
<p id="page14p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Behemoth's death has been preordained since the beginning of time, increasing its appeal as a patron of despair and lost causes. According to the oldest prophecies and scriptures (works that predate and predict the creation of Behemoth), when the mortal realm stands within days of utter destruction, Behemoth and Leviathan will meet in a final conflict to shake the foundation of the world.
The two great beasts will kill each other in this dread battle, and righteous mortals will be allowed to dine on their flesh forever in paradise—a fitting end for exemplars of unrelenting gluttony.
</p>
<p id="page14p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Behemoth stands more than a mile tall, appearing as a corpulent humanoid giant with the head of a four-tusked elephant, powerful arms, and trunk-like legs that end in clawed feet. Rot grubs the size of purple worms crawl in and out of vast tunnels bored throughout its distended belly, and it reeks of foul digestive juices and days-old rotting meat. The tip of its awesome trunk bears a terrible toothy maw, which the Great Beast uses to devour any- thing that fits within it (which is to say it devours nearly

everything). Like its infernal relative, Behemoth's favorite meal is the soul-stuff of the mortal dead.
</p>
<p id="page14p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Behemoth's personal Abyssal layer, the monstrous
Duidan, consists of endless veld built to the proportions of the Great Beast. Fiendish dire animals of all variet- ies roam the plains, seeking souls and other animals to devour. Few edible plants grow on the veld, as such spe- cies were eaten into extinction millennia ago. Everything consumed on Duidan must be hunted—and given the girth and hunger of the layer's prince, even the fiercest of hunters might become a meal at a moment's notice.
The lumbering master of the veld sleeps most of the time, wandering short distances in order to feed itself a few times a week. The ground shakes violently when Behe- moth is on the hunt, allowing smarter inhabitants to flee well in advance of the Great Beast's arrival. Its hunts can last for a whole day or more, as Behemoth never seems to tire of eating and never seems to reach its limit.
</p>
<p id="page14p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Though many hunters make offerings to Behemoth as a patron of wild animals, the Great Beast enjoys relatively few followers. Those it does have tend to be slovenly hedonists who have turned to gluttony in a final bid for self-destruction. Behemoth's cultists virtually sexualize the act of eating, playing up the erotic impact of food and bathing in grease and gristle as if anointing themselves with fragrant perfumes and massage oils.

When a mortal prince fears spies in his court, there's no telling how far he'll go to protect his reign. As his once- trusted advisors burn on pyres of suspicion and terror, the sovereign puffs up with self-admiration for completing his difficult task. He pays little attention to the flock of crows perched on the gallows crossbar or the gulls circling over- head waiting for the fires to die down so they might duck in for a quick meal. The birds, however, are more atten- tive. They see in the monarch a growing desperation. They know which of his advisors have been consumed by flame and which by fear, noting the survivors who might sell out their unstable leader in exchange for a return to sanity.
The birds see all, and all that the birds see is seen by their patron, Decarabia, "Sovereign of the Seventy-Seven Airs."

Decarabia claims all the skies as her personal domain and sees the birds that inhabit the firmament as her subjects.

</p>
<p id="page14p10" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
In form, Decarabia seems more human than most demon princes, though a number of features reveal her as a creature of the Lower Planes. A cold, harshly beautiful face is marred by four unusually twisted horns that emerge from her fore- head and just above her ears. Her alabaster skin is mirrored by milky white eyes bearing no pupils or color of any kind.
Bloodred lips and luxurious long black hair contrast her complexion in an unwholesome manner. Unsettling jagged wings flare from her elbows, granting her far more graceful flight than their appearance might suggest. Decarabia uses her sexuality as a tool and comports herself in as little cloth- ing as possible; she favors tight skirts and fetishized belts of black leather. She loves flight, spending her entire existence in the air. Years ago, she amputated her own legs to prove her dedication to the sky and its inhabitants.

Her personal layer, the Landless Aerie, reflects her interest in winged creatures and her disdain for solid earth. The layer's "ground" is a flat, featureless plain of solid metal extending for leagues in all directions. Above, however, countless rock islands float upon the winds, ranging in size from a few dozen feet in diameter to several miles wide.

But that's not in and of itself reason enough to give up on being heroic—or rather, on giving the impression of great heroism. The doctrine of Eligor, known colloquially as the
Widdershins Code, teaches that if knights leave no wit-nesses or survivors, they can tell the stories of their victories themselves, leaving out anything that would tarnish their reputations but was nonetheless required to remain alive.
Rather than flee a battle, Eligor's philosophy is to win by whatever dirty means necessary and leave the field with the appearance of honor and the admiration of one's peers.

Bedecked in viciously spiked, black full-plate armor, carrying a mighty shield, and armed with a horrifically barbed two-bladed sword, the Goodly Knight often wears a great batwing helmet that completely obscures his bes- tial face. He wears his hair in thick pleats gathered with tiny skull beads carved from human bone. Eligor's hid- eous, mocking smile reveals sharpened teeth stained red with the blood of his enemies.

The demon prince's ghastly realm is a parody of chivalric ideals, a blood-soaked fantasy in which every day is cause for a great festival and knightly tournament. Demons and souls combat one another in shows of gruesome violence without even a pretense of honor, much to the delight of legions of howling fans. Abyssal ladies give their scarves to the most treacherous knights, and great gifts of fine foods and enslaved mortals are granted to those with the highest body counts, regardless of how much they cheat to win (or perhaps to honor that cheating).
</p>
<p id="page15p9" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Eligor's followers know that discretion is often the better part of valor. Usually junior knights in the shadow of truly great warriors, Eligorans have seen the ugly side of armed conflict and refuse to fall to their enemies for any reason other than being outmatched in weapon play.
While they pay lip service to codes of chivalrous conduct and honorable warfare, they more often use their enemies'

dedication to such strictures against them. An Eligoran knight might, for instance, challenge an enemy to one-on-one combat using only nonmagical weapons, luring them to fight in a secluded spot where allies hide with poisoned crossbow bolts at the ready. If none see the treachery, they'll simply assume the best, granting the knight notoriety and fame they don't really deserve but enjoy all the same. Most gods of war, regardless of culture or alignment, loathe Eligor and his followers, and admitting to following the Goodly Knight at a knightly conclave is grounds for an instant challenge from the entire assembly. Wise Eligorans tend to keep their demonic affiliation a well-guarded secret.

Smoke and heat dominate the Bloodpyre Fields, Flau-ros's personal Abyssal domain. Volcanoes, lakes of fire, and rivers of magma pose numerous natural dangers here, giving the place a hellish cast common in many of the most basic images of a tormented afterlife. Searing-hot winds blast the entire layer, crisping flesh from bone. Breathing there is impossible for mortals without the assistance of magic or technology—even many demons find the place distasteful. Flauros himself wanders the plains, granting release from the confines of physical form to visitors and inhabitants alike, burning them with a fire so intense it leaves behind naught but a shadow of its target.

<p id="page16p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Something about fire attracts the most depraved, destructive members of society. Despite the seemingly altruistic goal of "freedom from form" that drives the leaders of Flauros's cult, the fact remains that most of his followers are absolute loons who get an indescribable thrill from lighting things on fire, philosophy be damned. Flau- rans set fire to buildings, hoping that sparks will ignite neighboring structures in a kind of natural evangelism.
They burn helpless victims (often children) because they like the smell of cooked flesh. Above all, their obsession is as much about power as it is about fire. Whoever sets things aflame has power over them, changing their form to ash in an act of almost divine transformation.

The world of mortals is but a shadowy reflection of pure potential. Everything that exists, from the smith's anvil to the flesh of a newborn babe, takes its shape from cor- ruption. That which has form betrays the perfect element from which all matter gains its animating force—fire. To set something (or someone) ablaze is to bless it, returning it to its ideal state in an act of compassionate emancipa- tion. So preaches the burgeoning cult of Flauros, which holds that the secrets of the multiverse can be found through the deconstruction of fire and light.
</p>
<p id="page16p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Such a heady philosophy attracts truth-seeking ascetic contemplatives who see wisdom in a doctrine riddled with references to the purifying aspect of fire. The litany of the
Son of Suns also encourages spreading fire as a reward for both people and objects; the more important or valuable, the greater the service provided. This celebration of fire's awesome capability for destruction attracts more than a few arsonists and rank psychopaths.
</p>
<p id="page16p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Flauros's many forms shift like the flames of a raging inferno. His very philosophy decries physical solidity as an insult to the natural order of things, so the Son of Suns pre- fers to change his image constantly. One shape, however, seems to predominate in his few appearances in the mortal realm and may in fact be his natural one. In this form, Flauros appears as an incredibly muscular giant having a skeletal bull's head with sharp teeth and impressive horns.
Crackling fire surrounds the figure's head and shoulders, casting off voluminous clouds of malodorous smoke.

Few cynical students of the occult are surprised upon learning of Gamigin, demonic patron to the power of universal constants death and taxes. When a chaotic evil creature dies, its soul manifests in the Abyss, where it either quickly learns to protect itself or is consumed by raven- ous hordes of demons. From the moment it arrives to the moment of its destruction, the soul's activities and where- abouts are monitored by Gamigin, the calculating demon prince known as the Soulcounter.
</p>
<p id="page16p8" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Gamigin weighs the value of each soul against archaic formulae, occasionally announcing an "imbalance" and dispatching a cadre of skullduggers (for more information see Skullduggers, page 218) to collect the debt owed to the Abyss. These servitors retrieve the soul and bring it to Gamigin's lair on the Jagged Tor of Final Reckoning, where it is fed into a boiling pit of magical tar known as the Last Morass. The process completely destroys the soul.
While Gamigin seems to derive some satisfaction from the power transfer, the true beneficiary is the Abyss itself, which grows stronger with each consumed soul. Some claim that Gamigin is not truly a demon prince but rather

The studious Gamigin wears the robes of a scholar and bears a volume known as the Spirit Ledger at all times.
His sole weapon is an oversized brush, which he employs to paint disastrous symbols upon the air in front of him when threatened by enemies. At his command, the brush can transform into a scythe. Gamigin has the head of a horse crowned by an impressive array of antlers.

The Jagged Tor of Final Reckoning is little more than a massive stone citadel situated upon a mile-tall mesa formed of knotty mutant flesh. Noxious clouds, poisonous even to demons, hug the layer's floor far below. Rumors of qlippoth infesting this occluded realm have never been substantiated.
Gamigin's citadel features endless hallways open for several stories. Huge, meticulously arranged bookcases line the walls. Records of every soul ever to pass into the Abyss, as well as the fate of those souls, can be found within these cases, but Gamigin seldom allows strangers to peruse his records.

Gamigin's followers on the Material Plane consist largely of liches or spellcasters well on the path to lichdom. Such beings have little use for the type of deals demon princes tend to offer. As undead creatures, their souls remain locked between the mortal world and the afterlife—safe, in a sense, from the attentions of demons. They approach Gamigin as equals, for he knows more about how to protect one's soul than perhaps anyone in the multiverse. The Soulcounter's cult is much more refined than the vile religion of Orcus, one of the most powerful demon princes in the Abyss. The rivalry between Gamigin and Orcus goes back to the rise of the demons, when each battled for greater influence over undeath. Gamigin lost that fight, ceding (for the most part) the administration of undeath on the Material Plane to his hated foe. Should Orcus show signs of weakness, however, Gamigin is more than willing to assume that coveted role.

The Ultimate Alchemist

<p id="page17p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
To transmute lead to gold or mold flesh like clay is to achieve the divine. The modern alchemist is the inheritor of a proud, ancient tradition that seeks ultimately to elevate mortals to the station of divinity by giving them power over the earth and over life itself. When base metals become precious by the application of sacred chemicals or when weird liquids and complex gestures ignite the spark of life in an artificial being, the alchemist has transcended mortal- ity and become a god of his own creation.
</p>
<p id="page17p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Nothing must stand in the way of the alchemist's pur-suit—not morality, family, love, friendship, or boundaries of propriety. Scientific advancement directs the alche- mist's every move. Consequences are irrelevant to the forward march of progress. So holds the lore of Haagenti, and his teachings have great allure for arrogant scientists who would crown themselves enlightened victors over the bloodied corpse of traditional, repressive religion.

<p id="page17p7" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The Ultimate Alchemist appears as a great amber bull with smoldering red eyes that seem to pulsate with the beating heart of the natural world. His raspy voice echoes like wind through abandoned mines, recollecting the toil the uneducated must endure to achieve material wealth.
Two great feathered wings, similar to those of a griffon, emerge from Haagenti's powerful back, representing the limitless bounds to which an alchemist might ascend if he successfully navigates the path to godhead.

alike at frightening speeds, and weapons of unthinkable power that project alchemical bullets with the force of a hun- dred crossbows. All such technology, however, bears some sign of its terrible cost. Wailing mortals perch like gargoyles atop awe-inspiring skyscrapers and mourn as they consider their own intestines and vertebrae, hardened through arcane procedures and used as cable and mortar to strengthen the structural integrity of the towers upon which they sit. Putrid, cloying smoke plagues the air, blotting out natural light and giving the layer an acidic smell. Vast herds of mortals abducted from the Material Plane clog sanitariums and hos- pitals, where they are sliced apart by workmanlike, analytical doctors and scientists searching for the means to prolong life, no matter the cost of the research. Termed the Hermetic
Horizon, Cerebulim gives a glimpse of a technological future unfettered by moral or ethical limitations upon progress.
</p>
<p id="page18p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Followers of Haagenti generally pursue tripartite goals: discover a process of transforming any metal to silver or gold, uncover an elixir to extend life indefinitely, and create artificial life in the form of constructed beings. The very concept of change fascinates them, as any transformation from one form to another might hold the key to attaining their sacred alchemical goals. Their stated ambition—to become divine through transformative power—predictably outrages members of more conservative religions, who hold that certain practices, by their nature, fall outside the realm of mortals. True practitioners of the faith exhibit a great deal of medical and alchemical skill, however, and can be of great assistance to those who don't know or care to know exactly how they gained their helpful knowledge. Haagen- tian alchemists view charlatans as a serious threat to their respectability and persecute them to the best of their ability whenever possible.

Throughout the mortal realm, certain sovereigns ban actors from entering their cities or performing in their lands. Men and women of loose morals and even looser reputations, actors receive treatment similar to that given lepers or heretics in some quarters. The craftiest find secret patronage from members of the effete nobility; the unlucky end up in stocks or worse. If more rulers knew about the decadent cult of Ipos and its pervasive popularity among performers, the actors' lot might be even harder. Instead of scrounging to find an appreciative audience, they might find themselves before a much more hostile group of spectators—a mob of torch-bearing zeal- ots just itching to cast them into the flames of redemption.
</p>
<p id="page18p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The cunning Ipos whispers knowingly to his enraptured audience of performers that life is but a grand production, that identity is nothing more than a role to be cast away at a moment's notice when necessary for the plot of life to pro- ceed to another act. While this philosophy encourages useful lessons of reinvention and discourages mulling over failure, it also teaches a disdain for morality: if nothing is truly real, there can be no consequences for one's actions. To ensure that their performances are memorable (for to make no impression at all is the greatest of mortal failings), followers of the Lord of Masques will cross any line. No sin is too perverse, no risk too great that it can't be endured for the sake of the show.
</p>
<p id="page18p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
As befits his title, Ipos can assume numerous forms, ranging from a terrible draconic beast to a simple dung-cov- ered pauper. He seems to favor one guise in particular, however—that of a tall, well-dressed rake with a lion's head, the feet of a goose, and the tail of a hare. Actors often paint such a figure onto their tents and stage works, waving their demonic affiliation under the noses of appreciative fans who see the animalistic image as a simple caricature meant to please children and the simpleminded.

play the part of groundlings near the plane's thirty-three connected stages, while a host of demonic nobility flock to the bleachers and private boxes. The entertainers them- selves are recently deceased actors, sworn to Ipos during mortal life, who revel in the chance to perform for all eternity. Hawkers of pleasures both simple and sublime roam the crowds, ensuring that all present sate them- selves upon some sort of mind-enhancing (or occasionally mind-numbing) concoction.
</p>
<p id="page18p8" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The Festive Everlasting possesses an air of idyll, but a competitive desperation permeates the theatrical atmo- sphere, noticeable to all who know to look for it. At the end of each three-hour performance, the crowd displays, by show of applause, its appreciation for each actor in turn. The five entertainers (out of about seven hundred) adjudged to have engaged in the worst or least memorable performance are erased from existence, their souls totally consumed by the Abyssal stage upon which they stood only moments before. Those actors who survive a year on the stage join the jeering crowd as demons, only slightly more sympathetic to the plight of the actors than the catty, demanding drama critics sitting next to them.
</p>
<p id="page18p9" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Ipos's decadent doctrine appeals to sensualist perform-ers who live for the false existence they portray upon the stage. Boiling down the whole of mortal experience to the familiar rules of performance makes sense to such bons vivants, who generally don't think far beyond making an impression upon the ever-present crowd. Ironically, such performers eventually disdain their audiences, seeing them as constantly demanding "mundanes" whose rigid ways allow them to live only through observing those willing to assume roles that they cannot. Performers sworn to
Ipos pity those who have but one face, but one voice, but one role to offer the world. Theirs is a much more vibrant experience, leading to much more fulfilling applause in the afterlife. Amoral bards adore the Lord of Masques.

Strip away the artificial strictures of civilization, chal-lenge the laws of nature, cast off the limitations of mortal imagination that force all things into easily understood categories, and you reveal glorious chaos. The only true universal constant, chaos gives animating force to life, determines the fates of all living things, and guides the progression of time. According to the teachings of Marbas, "Master of Fetid Change," that which openly proclaims its allegiance to chaos is closer to universal truth, unfettered by restrictions and free to float effortlessly and painlessly upon the undulating surface of fate. The deformed, diseased, and ugly, being variations from the norm, are the ultimate mortal representatives of chaos and should be honored as the harbingers of a new era in which chaos reigns eternal.

The Master of Fetid Change, in certain texts referred to as Barbas, appears as an ever-shifting mass of tumorous flesh covered in crooked horns and misshapen mouths.
Foul odors spew from numerous sphincters positioned randomly about its body, and enormous orifices and pow- erful internal organs allow Marbas to process what it has eaten (usually enemies) in an instant, spewing the remains upon itself in a torrent of bile.

Cancerous ichor seeps slowly from count- less crevasses at which different types of flesh conjoin, pooling upon the canyon floor to form coagulating streams of reeking fluids. Oozes and molds dominate the layer's moist corners, while ravenous chaos beasts roam on rare islands of solid ground. Marbas itself dwells in

It's difficult to guess what exactly attracts adherents to the Cult of Putrid Virtue, as Marbas's worship is known, but all who swear allegiance to the prince share an appre- ciation for the uglier things in life. Some are considered to have unattractive or even disturbing appearances, by the standards of the societies they belong to. These are targeted by cult missionaries, who tell them only Marbas will love and aid them. Others have been objectified for their beauty, and seek refuge in honest ugliness. All they require is a filth-slicked knife, a searing brand, and the will to inscribe their love for Marbas on their too-perfect skins. Regardless of their motives for joining, most cultists display a level of fervor best described as fanatical. They will go to any lengths to locate and obtain information on new diseases (the more grisly and disgusting the symptoms the better) and to &#34;correct&#34; the bodies of themselves and others they believe are blemished by symmetry, smoothless, and the other characteristics of conventional appeal.
</p>
<p id="page19p8" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Devotees of Marbas view themselves as protectors of the defenseless ugly and diseased, celebrating the unsightly aspects of life others would see healed, fixed, or eradicated.
They know well the resentment and fear felt toward them by those who do not share their afflictions and hope by spreading disease and mutation they will in turn spread a greater understanding of their own plight.

According to Nocticula, the sensual "Princess of Moon-light," only those graced with a womb possess the power to experience nature as it is meant to be experienced—a glori- ously chaotic panorama so complete in its majesty it cannot be fully appreciated by the mortal mind. Nocticula's earthy cult, the sisterhood of Sensates, believes the mind-altering properties of certain plants and fungi, coupled with &#34;femi- nine&#34; spiritual dispositions, can grant higher understanding of the limitless possibilities presented by nature's hidden landscapes. Members gather in secluded vales under the cover of moonlight to revel in erotic frolics enriched by the liberal ingestion of psychedelic drugs. To most, they represent harmless would-be faeries obsessed with self-in- dulgent pleasures. In fact, they are members of a relentless, widespread cult whose deep perception of the natural world gives them a powerful advantage over their enemies.

<p id="page19p10" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Nocticula frequently appears to her worshippers in hallucinogenic visions as a voluptuous wild woman with dried mud between her toes and a feral look in her deep brown eyes. The wry smile of her full lips reveals cunning intelligence and guile, and while she sometimes clothes herself in leather pants or a thick fur cloak, she prefers to travel as naked as the animals who inhabit her beloved wild spaces. She paints simple circles and lines upon her face, chest, and stomach, using natural dyes to accentuate her pale complexion. She resembles a mortal human more than nearly any other prince of the Abyss, but her form occasionally morphs slightly, without warning, and a dim, rapidly fading trail of light follows her every movement.

A Sister Sensate in the full embrace of nature's image-in-ducing powers sees a world in constant change. Such is the case with the Evershifting Vale, Nocticula's enchanting personal layer of the Abyss. There, in clearings ringed by autumnal trees, feminine demons and female souls join in common adulation of nature, painting their naked bodies with mud and dining upon psychedelic fungi a hundred times more potent than the most powerful drugs of the material world. The layer itself warps, quivers, and shakes as if controlled by a mad narcotic dream. Succubi generally manage individual covens in the Vale, while the insidious alrunes (see the entry on alrunes in Chapter 4: Creatures

evil-aligned fey sometimes venerate the Princess of Moon-light over the queen of their own dark faerie court. Though the Sisterhood excludes those who cannot bear children, the cult is far from dedicated to misandry. Nocticulans believe that men serve important roles in the wholeness of the natural world but cannot achieve complete understand- ing, with or without the aid of hallucinogens. Most of the order's more sensual ceremonies require the presence of at least one man, however, and several sympathetic males assist the cult whenever possible.

Should a Nocticulan learn of a man who has abused a woman or girl, however, she enlists the aid of her sis- ters to rain down merciless retribution upon him, often inviting the victim to join the Sisterhood after the man who wronged her has been dealt with appropriately. What strikes a Nocticulan as "appropriate" —let alone the broad definition applied to &#34;abuse&#34;—often seems downright vicious to outsiders. The Sisterhood's reliance on torture and mutilation tears a wide rift between it and other fem- inine nature cults, who view Nocticulans as drug-addled psychopaths whose propensity for whimsy makes them no less frightening and dangerous.

Raum was born a full-fledged demon prince in the future, a breath before the multiversal apocalypse eagerly awaited by followers of Abaddon and Astaroth.
Since then, he's aged in reverse—as time passes, Raum becomes more knowledgeable about the future that only he has experienced, while growing older and more decrepit as the years tick backwards. Always honored as a herald of the coming doom and a patron of hopeless- ness, Raum's unique perspective on things to come has of late made him a paragon of prophecy. Soothsayers, prognosticators, and fortune-tellers turn to Raum for information about the future—which he's willing to share, for a price.
</p>
<p id="page20p11" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The Harbinger of the Apocalypse obscures himself in voluminous gray robes, which hide a deteriorating form that grows more decrepit with each passing year. Raum doesn't understand why he's aging, but he expects to fade from exis- tence entirely within the decade, and the suspicion that he has not yet fulfilled the purpose of his creation now drives virtually all of his decisions and actions. After centuries of contemplation, he's concluded that he was created by the
Lords of Good to prevent the apocalypse, as a sort of sleeper agent within the Abyss. His preferred means of doing so, however, reveals his chaotic evil nature.

place. The multiverse would be destroyed somewhat ear-lier, but at least Raum would prevent the later annihilation of all that is. Further, by erasing himself from creation, he could be absolved of the sin of wiping out the multiverse.
Already heavy with the guilt of being involved in any apocalypse at all, Raum views the absolution of nothing- ness as the only reward worth fighting for anymore.

He long ago stopped active defense of Dizalakine, his personal layer of the Abyss. No demonic armies guard its gate and borders, and the prince exerts none of his energies fortifying the layer's natural defenses. The place would be completely overrun by invaders if not for the fact that Dizalakine offers nothing to its occupier—no cities, no resources of great (or even modest) value, and no indigenous life worth stealing or enslaving. Forlorn, windswept, and ignored, the flat plains of the so-called
Gate of Entropy stand awaiting a new lord, passed over time and again by would-be usurpers simply because the current tenant allowed things to get so bad the dregs are hardly worth bothering with. Raum himself occasionally strolls the darkened plains, crying softly to himself while engaging in sad conversations with remembered friends who have yet to be born.

Sabnach is unusual for a demon prince in that he is honored widely in an aspect that only touches on his true nature.
At the most superficial level, masons and architects view him as embodying protection through edifice, a brilliant extraplanar strategist who urges the strengthening of walls and reinforcement of natural defenses as the best fortifica- tion. More canny practitioners of the masonic arts know
Sabnach represents the duality of fortifications and the natural forces of decay that work against their permanence.
Walls and redoubts are sworn to the Wormworn Protector in hopes of prolonging their longevity and protection while at the same time recognizing (and hopefully placating) those natural forces that might work against them. Walled cities, the most obvious symbols of Sabnach's teachings, represent the apogee of mortal achievement in the masonic arts, and hence Sabnach has gained a role as a patron of civilization.
</p>
<p id="page21p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Devotees of the most perverse, most genuine aspect of Sabnach's cult, however, know that the demon prince urges the construction of walls and the development of cities because he also gains power from disease and lazi- ness. The spread of civilization into wildlands brings with it a glorious propagation of diseases upon the virginal landscape. They believe the safety of cities breeds over- confidence and laxity of defense, which in turn results in more prayers to Sabnach, as the des- perate hope to make up for their masters' oversights by making ill-considered pacts with the underworld. Whether the city stands tall or is threatened by barbarians, Sabnach profits.
</p>
<p id="page21p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Sabnach has three favored forms, using each to communicate with a distinct body of followers.
Those who honor the Wormworn
Protector as a guardian of forti-fications see him as an elegantly aging, heavily mustached human gentleman in well-crafted but bat- tle-worn armor. Those who praise his civilizing aspect see a similarly armored figure, but with a thickly maned feline head. Sabnach's most devoted followers, who know his true agenda, see him as a gargantuan, corpulent rat sitting atop a mound
</p>
<p id="page21p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
of shattered columns. All three forms bear a simple iron crown on their heads.
</p>
<p id="page21p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The whole of Sabnach's small Abyssal layer is taken up by Restarion, doubtless one of the largest castles in the multiverse. For millennia, the Wormworn Pro- tector and the souls and demons sworn to him have toiled upon the unthinkably huge fortress. The work has gone on so long that portions of the castle have fallen into utter disrepair while construction begins on brand-new levels and towers miles away. So much of Restarion has decayed that the castle has become known as the Rotting Palace. Tiny worms infest the entire fortress, tunneling their

visions: hazy, half-understood images of the future. Those lunatics whose predictions bear fruit are known as Chil- dren of Raum, in homage to the demon prince's double patronage of the future and hopeless causes. The Children (those sane enough to function in society, at any rate) dominate Raum's cult, which also teems with seers and

fortune-tellers, including a fair number of charlatans. Few openly admire the Harbinger's apocalyptic goals (naively viewing these as a minor aspect of his patronage), but all adore chaos and anarchy. They frequently spur on natural and political catastrophes, directly in service of Raum or because it's simply their nature to do so.

A common philosophy holds that the world is inher-ently lawful—all things are situated at a specific, set distance from one another, for order is the true nature of the Material Plane. The Patron of Portals and his followers specialize in bending those "absolute" dis- tances, carving literal wounds in the world by traveling from one place to another via the most destructive means possible. The hand of Seere can be seen when a new road cuts through unspoiled wilderness; when a wealthy merchant installs teleportational portals in two cities, maximizing profit by cutting out dozens of middlemen; and when a native people are, through exploration and exploitation, absorbed into the common culture of the civilized world.
</p>
<p id="page22p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Like his allies Sabnach and Socothbenoth, Seere bears a somewhat human appearance, perhaps to appeal to the civilized folk of the settled world. The Patron of Portals stands roughly seven feet tall, with short red hair and two twisting horns peeking from his angular forehead. He otherwise resembles a normal human and often is seen riding upon a pale horse. Seere prefers to dress in the most stylish fashions of high society, favoring tailored coats and elaborate capes that grant him the appearance of a wealthy merchant. He walks with a slight limp, supporting him- self on a mighty traveler's staff.
</p>
<p id="page22p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Seere's confounding layer of the Abyss, known collo-quially as the Final Highway, is a void partially filled by a twisting path of hard-packed earth that winds throughout the layer and is visible from every point within Seere's realm. At times the road stretches up a great distance, as if traversing a great hill. Such hills, however, don't exist anywhere beyond the surface of the road itself. Those who fall from the path (or, as is often the case, are pushed from it) fall for eternity unless they slam into another part of the highway far below. Souls sworn to Seere or captured by his agents roaming the Howling Threshold believe that
</p>
<p id="page22p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
the road has an end and those who reach it pass the test of the Patron of Portals to achieve enlightenment and pass on to some sort of Abyssal paradise. It's a sham—the road extends for what seems an eternity before looping back upon its start (no one has ever made it so far), but Seere does nothing to disabuse his subjects of their lofty goals.
Of course, the majority of these folk are chaotic evil, so the typical dangers of the road—highwaymen, corrupt checkpoint guards requiring fees for passage, and even wandering creatures (in the form of flying beasts who emerge from the void)—are even more dangerous on the
Final Highway than their counterparts on the byways of the mortal world.
</p>
<p id="page22p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Seerians believe the physical growth of civilization necessitates the absorption of native cultures into the greater body. Small elements of absorbed societies thus eventually come to be observed by the populace at large, infusing the common culture with disparate components in a cacophonous paean to chaos. By "infecting" civi- lization with a multiplicity of hard-dying philosophies and belief systems sprung from the corpses of conquered lands, progress weakens society's overall reliance on law.
And with the inevitable weakening of laws, crow Seeri-ans, the groundwork is laid for the advancement of evil.
Seerians do their part by organizing trade caravans and expeditions, hoping to turn up areas rich in resources for later exploitation. In the wild they act as guides, and in cities they often serve unscrupulous merchant companies, enhancing their ability to damage the world and displace native peoples simply for the joy of turn- ing a buck.
</p>
<p id="page22p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Whenever a thaumaturge in service to the Patron of
Portals teleports (either via their own magic or a spell cast by another) they appear at the destination standing in a shallow pool of deep red blood—a wound torn into the sacred order of the natural world.

<p id="page22p7" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
way through wood and stone and weakening the whole.
Rats (normal, dire, and fiendish) roam Restarion with impunity, spreading so much disease throughout the fortification that the entire layer is harmful to those not immune to illness. Sabnach favors hezrou and nalfeshnee guardians, who protect the castle as best they can from the adventuring souls and mortals drawn by legends of fabulous treasure chambers secreted beneath Restarion's ever-increasing bulk.
</p>
<p id="page22p8" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
To the average observer, Sabnach appears to have very few devoted followers, although incantations are often said to him, even by clerics of other faiths, to bestow protection upon a given locale or to bless a newly built redoubt, wall, or battlement. In fact, Sabnach's cult thrives in the cities of the mortal world, spreading disease and sloth under the
</p>
<p id="page22p9" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
shadows of civilization. Those advocating the expansion of city walls or national borders to include substantial wildlands, those pressing for more construction and the accommodation of more serfs and refugees within the populace of the city, and those calling for innovation and industry at the expense of the natural world—all speak, intentionally or not, with the voice of the Wormworn Pro- tector. Many cultists infest municipal government, often forming secret societies of tradesfolk to effect slothful city life and expand civilized borders through aggressive trade and exploration. Followers of Sabnach honor worms, vermin, and rats as the natural agents of their liege and do whatever they can to avoid harming such creatures. Those thaumaturges who summon a familiar generally choose a rat or some type of vermin.

Some demon princes concoct intricate philosophies to trick mortals into following them to eternal damnation. Shax, a ruthless Abyssal sovereign, makes no such claims of altru- ism. His liturgy holds that the body of a sentient creature is a microcosm, a living symbol of the greater universe. The secrets of the world are hidden in veins and subcutaneous tissue, and those who release those secrets by opening the flesh exert ultimate power upon that microcosm, in a sense attaining a sliver of the divine with the slash of a scalpel.
Devotees refer to cutting up their victims as "achieving the demiurge," deifying the moment at which they transcend mortality with their hands buried wrist deep in cooling organs. The philosophy's utter lunacy appeals to the crimi- nally insane, who are thankfully rare, but a more significant threat has developed within the last decade.
</p>
<p id="page23p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
After wallowing in obscurity for centuries among the wailing, mad souls consigned to his Abyssal home, Shax decided to raise his profile. His demonic servants ensured his philosophy made its way to disaf- fected young human nobles in various cities throughout the mortal realm. These men and women have brought Shaxan doctrine to their decadent friends and slake their overwhelming boredom by embracing the teachings of the demon prince. The nobles are lurid sensualists who fancy themselves as having discovered a great new philosophical frontier in the mutilation of flesh. They murder vagrants in the night, undermine local institutions of order, and get away with it in style. As their infamy spreads, so, too, does their influence. Shax, it would seem, has finally come into his own.
</p>
<p id="page23p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Shax appears as a powerful humanoid with stork-like legs and the head of a dove. He seldom wears a shirt and prefers to be covered from head to toe in blood. He wields a number of prods, saws, and blades in combat, often favoring whatever will inflict the most gruesome wounds upon his enemies. When conversing, Shax speaks with a hoarse voice that makes a painful experience of listening to his depraved ravings. His completely black avian eyes reflect an insane vacancy—it's impossible to read Shax's emotions by looking into those stolid pools of darkness.
Known as the Great Crippling Gaze for the unsettling nature of his eyes, the demon prince prefers screams over parley, the dead over the living.

Rusted, filth-soaked gurneys trundle along the cramped hallways of the Charnelhome, Shax's Abyssal domain.
Pushed along by vacuous dretches, the gurneys hold the whimpering bodies of tortured souls who lie quivering in thin puddles of blood, bile, and festering guts. Floating balls of continual flame shed harsh illumination upon tile walls marred with the sticky leavings of life. There are no exits or windows in the Charnelhome, nor is there evidence that the layer exists beyond its grim interior. Hideously eviscerated and lobotomized souls aimlessly wander the
</p>
<p id="page23p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
endless hallways, absently looking for some sort of half-re-membered life beyond the hellish sanitarium. Those souls who honored the Great Crippling Gaze in life serve the prince not as victims but as surgeon-philosophers who carve into their "patients" with academic zeal. Shax houses him- self at the center of the structure, reading the reports of his inferiors and chuckling with raspy glee.
</p>
<p id="page23p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Upper-class followers of Shax will do anything to anyone, simply to get off on something they've never seen before. They often gather in intimate social clubs to care- fully plan their attacks, then retreat to sympathetic cafés where, bloodied, they lock themselves in private rooms, regaling each other with tales of their own horridness while inhaling narcotic smoke from imported hookahs. Ruthless and sociopathic in the extreme, this new breed of Shaxans uses political and familial connections to add an element of intrigue to their dark dealings. The old school carries on, regardless of the new attention from the gentry. With
Shax's wicked approval, these babbling, incoherent lunatics struggle are aroused by while gutting unfortunates with broken bottles and cast-off bits of sharp metal, confident in the efficacy of their old-fashioned philosophies.

Devotees of the demon prince Socothbenoth follow a philosophy where the exploitation of sexual taboos is the truest manifestation of natural law. According to their popular views, that which feels good is good, simply because nature wills it so—no sexual fetish can be wrong if it brings pleasure to the person indulging in it. Taboos, as strictly mortal inventions, are to be cast away as blights on the face of nature, which is an almighty force govern- ing even the gods themselves. "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law," according to Socothbenoth's lurid litany. Yet boiled to its core, Socothbenoth's teachings praise the ecstasy of his followers. Everyone else is just so much flesh to be used, and it is this which sets his cult apart from the factions of kinder libertines.
</p>
<p id="page24p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Socothbenoth appears as a handsome, rakish human man with long brown hair and pure white skin. A pair of donkey ears (replete with piercings) jut straight up from the sides of his head, and his face seems perpetually marked by a knowing, seductive smirk. The demon prince prefers to dress lightly in riding boots and leather pants, eschewing shirts to show off the six immense barbells piercing his chest horizontally in a single vertical row. His long, rounded fingernails seem manicured specifically to tease, and an abnormally long tongue occasionally slips out from between his lips, giving him the appearance of a salacious snake. Socothbenoth is known by many names, including Succor-Beloth and Succorbenoth. Nocticula, the sultry Princess of Moonlight, spends a great deal of time at Socothbenoth's side. The demon prince knows her both as a sister and a lover—together the two push the limits of ecstasy, surrendering their human mores bit by bit until they degenerate into beasts and fiends ruled by instinct alone. However, in the public realm, they present a unified, powerful alliance to their numerous enemies.

trill innocuous songs as they flutter from tree to tree, stretching their colorful wings in the welcoming light of a warm sun. Small clearings mark the woodland here and there, their soft beds of flowers giving comfort to young lovers fumbling at each other's clothes. No demons inhabit this outer landscape, and souls and the living alike dwell together in a handful of towns scattered through- out the layer. A towering edifice dominates the center of the forest, giving a name to the whole domain—the
Cathedral Thelemic. Decked out with the iconography of dozens of good-aligned religions, the so-called "Church of Free Will" is home to thousands of entrapped souls whose attempts to unethically slake their sexual thirst in life consigned them to an eternity in the Abyss. Under the tutelage of a priesthood made up of succubi and incubi, and under the gaze of impassive stone angels, the souls spend every minute of every day indulging in the most prurient proclivities imaginable. The souls have until multiversal oblivion to work out their kinks, and in the eternity of the Cathedral Thelemic, everyone assumes every role eventually.

<p id="page24p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Socothbenoth's followers are difficult to classify.
Most view their faith as an intensely personal matter, often because they first discovered hints of the demon prince's agenda scribbled in the margins of surrepti- tiously purchased books of erotic poetry or collections of pornographic woodcuts. Enlightened followers spread the word of the Patron of the Sighing Tents, enticing new members to the movement with fetching pouts and nimble tongues. Nature, they claim, honors their indulgences, giving pleasure in return. Socothbenothans (sometimes for fear of reprisal after death) honor the infallibility of natural law above the decrees of the gods, disdaining any who would place morality in the way of sexual fulfillment.

He's been known to manifest aboard a ship in the minutes before it goes under, proffering its crew safety in return for their cargo. Some- times he tells them they must offer up three of their own to the Abyss before he will calm the waters—Vepar delights in watching formerly tight crews fall upon each other to save their own hides. Rarely, he even allows the three sacrifices to live, casting their betrayers into the seas as snacks for inhu- man servitor creatures dwelling below the waves.

Slavers honor Vepar as the patron of their cruel trade, praying to him to reveal the best naval routes to new lands rife with material and human riches. Vepar, in turn, thrives on the suffering of the slaves in disease-ridden, filthy cargo holds. He delights in the eradication of "primitive" soci- eties, seeing this as necessary in order to spread cultures dependent upon sea travel for their sustenance. Once they dominate the world, the Master of Angry Waters intends to visit it personally, demanding tribute from all while holding the trade of every nation in his clawed, rubbery fingers.

The conflict between good and evil is the heart of most great games. Usually, evil is a force beyond common understand- ing. The forces of Hell and the Abyss are so evil the average mortal would go mad with just a glimpse of their far-reach- ing plans and all-encompassing wickedness. Indeed, mortals that tie themselves to these outside planes are thought by most to have sold their very souls, to have become so deeply malevolent they no longer bear any real similarity to other members of their race. But Hell and the Abyss are not the only Outer Planes, and not all fiendish powers are beyond the comprehension of the common person.

<p id="page25p13" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
When neutral evil mortals die, if they have been wholly dedicated to the path of their alignment, their souls are con- signed to Gehenna. Unlike other fiendish domains, Gehenna is not overseen by malefic lords bent on conquest or hatching schemes to topple the gods and swallow up the multiverse.
No, Gehenna's evil is less showy than all that but, according to scholars like Goodfellow, far more insidious.

Here are the whis- perers and watchers who sit over each person's shoulder throughout the course of their lives, inviting them to take the wicked path, eschew what they know is right, embrace self-interest, and reject their charitable nature. Here are the mercenaries of the endless war between Hell and the
Abyss, always switching sides whenever they receive a better offer—or so it would seem—though their fickle loy- alty does nothing so much as prolong the war and ensure their eternal employment.

Good made an agreement with the outcasts of Gehenna.
These sad creatures received their own plane, power, and a place in the universe. In return, they agreed to record the evil deeds done by mortal peoples and, most importantly, to keep the war between their neighbors burning hot for all eternity.
A Hell and Abyss at war are safer for the multiverse, the
Lords of Good reasoned, and thus far it has proven true.

Regardless of the cause and true history of its creation, most agree that Gehenna is now the fiendish plane most tied to the Material Plane. Its lords aren't just aware of mortal affairs—they watch and influence them. The inhab- itants of Gehenna even include mortals who have made the
Seven-Circle Realm their home, preferring the clarity of its raw evil to the Material Plane. Accessible by mortals, devils, demons, celestials, and creatures of negative energy alike, Gehenna is the hub of the fiendish planes, rendering it a place both deeply terrifying and profoundly useful for those seeking to make otherworldly alliances.

Gehenna is a great flat plane in the form of a giant circle.
The outer part of this circle is called the war zone, for the simple reason that all around this outer circle the war between Hell and the Abyss rages. The war zone forms an enclosure around six smaller circles that, in turn, encircle one central circle. They are the Circle of Wrath, Circle of
Envy, Circle of Lust, Circle of Sloth, Circle of Gluttony, Circle of Greed, and the Circle of Pride.
</p>
<p id="page26p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Each of the internal circles is ruled by one of the exarchs of Gehenna. These powerful daemons (mostly) are the lords of the Seven-Circle Realm, though they have neither supreme authority nor any firm laws. Indeed, each seeks only to further their own aims and strengthen the power of their circle.
</p>
<p id="page26p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Whatever theory one ascribes to regarding the creation and purpose of Gehenna, one thing is clear: each of its circles directly connects to the sins of mortal kind. As mortals commit sinful deeds, petty or profound, they are observed in the appropriate circle, and the mere commis- sion of the deed lends strength to the daemons of that land and its lord. How mortals are observed in these acts is a matter of debate. Most agree that through some prop- erty of Gehenna (perhaps its proximity to the Material
Plane or perhaps through its agreements with the gods of
Heaven), all people cast a dark shadow of themselves into the Seven-Circle Realm throughout their lives. As they do ill, their shadows wander into the appropriate circle, where their deeds are scrutinized and recorded by the resi- dents, all of whom delight in wickedness.
</p>
<p id="page26p7" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
As the daemons observe these sins, they write them up in great dark ledgers. The purpose of these ledgers is the source of much debate. Some call the dark ledgers the

T he War Zone
</p>
<p id="page26p13" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Stretching out in all directions from the Seven-Circle
Realm is a blasted wasteland worn down to craters and flaming pits over countless millennia of warfare. It is a place of blood, bile, and ichor, a place where suffering, pain, and fear are as palpable as a lover's embrace. At all times, demons and devils fight their interminable war against each other, expending themselves in a desperate struggle for dominance in the planes. Goaded by the exarchs who rule the seven circles, opponents allow reason to play no part in the struggle. Each setback, each defeat, merely spurs the losing side to redouble its efforts and resume the struggle for dominance. No victory is ever complete, just as no defeat is final. The fallen soldiers lie where they fell, fodder for the gluttonous demons and ravenous scavengers who slither and skulk across the battlefields.
</p>
<p id="page26p14" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
What most find maddening about the war zone is that there is nothing to conquer, nothing to hold. Neither side sees value in the landscape across which they march. After all, the war zone was stripped of anything and everything of value long, long ago. Still, the demonic horde gathers its strength and throws itself against the bulwarks raised by its infernal enemies, sometimes breaking through and forcing the devils to retreat to some other squalid corner of the realm. And at other times, the devils chew up the attacking demons, breaking them on the points of their spears and sending them scurrying back into the darkness.
</p>
<p id="page26p15" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Since demons and devils use this place as their eternal bat-tlefield, only breaking through to invade the Abyss or Hell rarely, such fiends are the ones most likely to be encountered here. The daemons have keen interest in seeing the fighting continue, and thus mercenaries sold by the various exarchs can be found swelling the ranks of one side or the other.
Undead drawn from the Negative Energy Plane tend to stumble into the raging battle as well, though such beings often find themselves slaughtered and trampled by the hard- ened veterans pressing whatever advantage they can.
</p>
<p id="page26p16" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Outsiders who come to the war zone find the place uninviting and dangerous to the extreme. Visitors from the Material Plane might be conscripted to fight for the devils or assaulted and devoured by vicious demons. Only the most powerful travelers have a chance at driving off these fiends for any length of time, but even they discover the folly of exploring this realm when the number of ene- mies never seems to diminish and they, like many before them, find themselves victims to the unchecked violence that defines this horrifying place.

Bands of insane soul forms roam the fields and forests, attacking anyone not part of their tribes and butchering the bodies, hacking them into undifferentiated hunks and leaving the mutilated remains behind.

Tyrexxus, the Black Horn, rules the circle as exarch.
The fighting raging across his realm consumes his attention fully, much to the relief of his rivals, since his hatred for the other exarchs over historic slights, real and imagined, would otherwise lead him to wage war against them. A great towering giant clad in black spiked armor, Tyrexxus spends much of his time stomping across his realm, savaging daemons and soul forms alike with sweeps of his blade and spiked chain. His roars can be heard across the circle, and, rather than inspiring fear, they inflame the hatred burning in the hearts of those condemned to this place, driving them to commit even greater acts of appalling violence.
</p>
<p id="page27p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Most daemons use the Circle of Wrath as a training ground before undertaking missions in the war zone. These daemons fight against each other so that only the strongest and toughest survive. The brutality with which they fight each other resembles somewhat the raw savagery of demons and might lead some to mistake these fiends for their cha- otic evil kin. But instead of being controlled by their anger, they focus it with surprising effectiveness.
</p>
<p id="page27p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Of all the realms of Gehenna, the Circle of Wrath stands closest to the gate leading to the Abyss. Chaotic influence bleeding from this realm contributes to the madness grip- ping the minds of those fighting here. Demons sometimes slip across the border to join in the fighting, which gives
Tyrexxus's daemons opportunities to test their mettle against some of the most dangerous fiends in the multiverse.

The Circle of Envy stands atop Utter Darkness, a yawning portal to the Negative Energy Plane. Emanations from the Negative Energy Plane spill out into this dark place and permeate it, shrouding everything in gloom while slowly leaching life and vitality from its inhabitants. High towers thrust up from this dominion, their gray stones slick with the rain that perpetually falls from the sodden skies above. Slick streets wend their way between the tall buildings, each festooned with swiveling eyes that watch for any signs of intruders who might venture within the structures and make off with the treasures they contain.

Proximity to the void gives Ulasta the means to assem-ble her armies from the corpses littering the war zone and other locations in Gehenna. Stitching together the parts and pieces harvested from the bloody battlefield, her dae- mons create undead thralls that obey her every command.
Many of the undead are the same as those found in the

Few places rival the horror and beauty found in In'nassi's
Circle of Lust. A wondrous realm far removed from the violence of the other realms, it features perfumed gar- dens, palaces in which every pleasure can be sampled, and daemons of astonishing beauty and allure, all of whom conceal the hideous truth of their being behind comely masks. The seeming paradise encompassed by the circle's high walls masks the debauched underbelly and perils that unchecked lust present to incautious visitors. Visitors to this place might find their every want met for a time, only to find themselves hunted amidst the sighing souls, from which they might notice secret, resentful gazes. The lust-chained, daemon and damned alike, are ever driven to seek satisfaction, but can never find it, and so envy they living, who have not yet cursed themselves by cheapening their own passions with greed, deception, and cruelty.
</p>
<p id="page28p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
In'nassi of the Red Petals and the Iron Rod rules the
Circle of Lust from an enormous palace rising from the top of a high hill at the center of the realm. Carved from pink porphyry, reliefs decorating the exterior present the sexual organs of an untold number of creatures, punctu- ated with frescos and friezes depicting unlikely pairings of different creatures engaged in carnal acts. Although the carvings and statuary appear to be carved from stone, they feel warm and supple to the touch, almost as if alive.
</p>
<p id="page28p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Few people have entered the exarch's palace and emerged with their sanity intact, but legends claim that the expression of all desires, no matter how profane or disturbing, can be found in its corridors. The sighs and screams lifting up from the structure testify to the unspeakable atrocities that take place within its confines each day and night without end.
</p>
<p id="page28p7" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Depictions of the exarch vary wildly, since In'nassi rarely dons the same form twice, able to freely move between kind and gender in accordance with the exarch's whims. Generally, In'nassi assumes a striking form, pos- sessed of both male and female organs. In any shape, a mere glimpse of the exarch inflames passions and stirs feelings of longing that demand release. In'nassi's influence affects all creatures, and it's thought that the exarch can even awaken passion in a corpse. In'nassi has at various times taken other exarchs as lovers, usually to manipulate them into protecting or furthering the dae- mon's interests.

Situated nearest to Hell's gate, the daemons of the Circle of Sloth cannot be bothered to slow the advance of the infernal armies as they march forth to engage the demonic horde. Neglect has reduced the Circle of Sloth to a fester- ing quagmire of rubble, filth, and rot. Structures that once rivaled the beauty found in the Circle of Lust have all but collapsed, and what still stands is draped with creepers, spotted with mold, and stained.

The exarch who rules the circle is known as Viasta, "the Broken Promise," but no one has seen the daemon in nearly a thousand years. Believed old and powerful, Viasta abandoned all responsibility for his dominion long ago and now spares no thought for the blighted place or the machinations and intrigues of his rivals. Most assume he reclines in some subterranean chamber, moldering away as he awaits the end of the universe. Heretical scholars claim he is not even a daemon but is, in fact, the most power- ful being in all the multiverse, the Creator, who, having become exhausted by his work and disgusted by the short- comings of his creations, has simply given up. Though it is within his power to fix every flaw in the world, to save those unjustly injured, to do and achieve boundless good, he cannot be bothered and instead lurks within his domain doing nothing at all.

Many inhabitants of the Circle of Sloth fell from the
Heavens. Once angels, the duties and service wore at them until they gave up. Their surrender resulted in their fall into the wretched filth of the Circle of Sloth, where they lie in a fugue state, heedless of what goes on around them.
Even the daemons who dwell here find it difficult to stir themselves into action, and the only enticement that can budge them is the promise of the fresh souls of the lazy and indolent when they tumble into the daemons' grasp.

Daemons take delight in their compulsive eating, eager to fit more into their forms until they finally burst apart, their grisly remains becoming food for the hungry daemons all around them.

The twisting and turning passageways shift and move, while diabolical traps lie in wait to snatch and maim the unwary. Legend holds Mytaxx was once a mortal man who bought him- self rulership of a circle of Gehenna, the Circle of Greed.

Few have ever seen Mytaxx, for he fears that all covet the treasures he has accumulated. Mytaxx seeks to own everything there is. He would take the stars themselves, if he could, but he is kept occupied by his obsessive hoard- ing of that which he already holds. Paranoid, greedy, and obsessed with the wonders he has claimed so far, he always casts an eye outward, eager to snatch whatever he can to add to his impossible fortune.

The Circle of Pride is home to Gravicarius, "the Shining

It is his firm belief there is nothing he cannot do, but he is pleased by what he does now, which is to make sure that the dark ledgers of Gehenna are recorded and their purpose (whatever it might be) is fulfilled. If it is true that Gehenna is in league with the Lords of Heaven, prolonging the war between
Hell and the Abyss and recording mortals' sins so that they might be judged, then this agreement was surely bro- kered by Gravicarius. Though he is not king of Gehenna, he is unquestionably its greatest citizen.

Some say daemons were the first race, accursed by the gods for their pride and made into the horrid creatures they are today. Others believe they are the dross of demons and devils, trans- formed through some power (infernal, divine, or arcane) into a breed in their own right.

For these rea- sons, he rarely leaves the safety of his citadel, relying on his underlings to feed him intelligence and carry out his orders. While Dispater reacts slowly to threats and always hedges his bets, once he has decided on a course of action, he responds with overwhelming force.

Long ago, the gods created Hell to serve as a prison for the demons they defeated in the Abyss and elsewhere in the multiverse. Its original purpose, however, was lost after the rebellion in Heaven that resulted in the fall of the angelic host. These fallen celestials tumbled into Hell, where they were transformed into devils by the evil nature of the place. Now ruled by Asmodeus, the King of Hell, Hell has become a place for the souls of mortals who embraced order for wicked ends, mortals who bargained with the devils, and anyone else who has come under infernal sway. There are few places in the multiverse worse than Hell.

Hell pay homage to Asmodeus, the Lord of the Ninth Circle, King of Hell, and adversary of all that is good.

The uppermost circle of Hell stands as the first line of defense against invasion by the plane's myriad enemies.
Chief among Hell's foes are the rapacious demons who seek to plunder Hell of its souls and lay waste to the arrogant lords and ladies who rule this realm. Thus, the
First Circle features high walls punctuated with grim towers, while bulwarks and fortifications crisscross the blasted landscape to thwart the progress of any invading force. Hell's armies are arrayed across this circle, drilling day and night in readiness for war. And when the war has need for fresh troops to drive back the demons in
Gehenna, the battalions march from here through Hell's gate to meet the foe without question or hesitation.

The politics of Hell are complex and ill understood by mortals. The basic structure is feudal. Asmodeus is the
King of Hell, and the eight other lords are his chief vassals. Each lord maintains a court populated by a bewil- dering array of dukes, counts, marquesses, barons, and so on. The lords rank these nobles in different ways, which, when combined with devils' penchant for multiple names, makes keeping track of the hierarchy quite difficult.
</p>
<p id="page32p15" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Beneath the infernal nobility are the common devils.
These range from the pitiful lemures to the powerful pit fiends. These devils serve the various powers of Hell as tools, fodder, and occasionally food. Even the lowliest devil knows that their only hope is to climb up the hier- archy by any means. Murder, blackmail, and deception of every conceivable kind are used to ascend the infernal ladder. Once a devil becomes a noble, they can take a new form and become an individual for the first time. The most powerful nobles serve in the courts of the archdevils and command legions of lesser devils.

Shortly after the Lords of Good achieved their position of prominence in the Upper Planes, they banded together in an act of creation that resulted in the birth of the archons, servitors made from the very stuff of goodness. These beings were arranged in a single great hierarchy shared even by contesting good deities and ruled by the most powerful of the new celestials.
</p>
<p id="page32p20" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
For eons, the archons served admirably and without fault. The Lords of Good, however, soon grew tired of their rigidity. The archons, they reasoned, worshipped them because they were created to worship them, and hence were not an accurate representation of the value of good over evil. To prove this, the gods proposed a creature with complete self-will, limited by a terminal lifespan.
The lords presented this new creation to their servitor race and stated that henceforth the lawful celestials would serve these mortals as if they were gods.
</p>
<p id="page32p21" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
By this act, the Lords of Good introduced the sins of pride and envy to the archons. Iblis, a powerful seraph who had purged the Material Plane of a troublesome elder people known as the genies, felt betrayed in clearing the way for this new, flawed creation. He refused to serve the mortals and was cast from the Heavens to the depths of
Hell. With Iblis fell one-third of the angelic host, thou-sands of celestials who, having lost the status of favored beings, turned their backs on the Lords of Good and suc- cumbed to sin. This event, the Primogenital Rebellion, is seen by many as the birth of conflict in the Upper Planes.
It certainly had repercussions in the lower realms.

Demons, devils, and other wicked creatures presented in the Monster Manual offer the foundation on which this chapter builds. Here, you will find details on a dazzling array of nightmarish creatures you can use as adversaries, allies, and ser- vants for the protagonists. While many creatures stand against the adventurers' efforts and might be encountered during forays into the Lower Planes, others might answer summons to the Material Plane to serve as willing or unwilling soldiers in the characters' fight against darkness and evil. Many monsters described here might not be immediately hostile to the adventurers and may instead work to seduce them with promises of power, wealth, and glory, in exchange for a paltry offer- ing of the soul.

<p id="page35p9" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The daemons inhabit the seven-circled realm known as Gehenna. Some believe these fiends were offshoots of demons and devils, while others argue they are the embodiment of the various strains of evil emanating from that accursed plane. Whichever tale is true, daemons have a keen interest in the mortal world and delight in the wickedness they find there.
</p>
<p id="page35p10" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Daemons have a strong connection to the exarchs they serve, and many adopt certain characteristics that set them apart from others, usually giving them some mastery over the sin or vice they embody. Thus, daemons from the Circle of Wrath are much different from those found in the Circle of Envy. Such differences do not make them any weaker or more vulnerable than the others; they merely frame the tactics the daemons employ.
</p>
<p id="page35p11" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Aside from the variations by circle, daemons also carry out specific functions within and between their circles.
Unlike Hell, where the roles are hierarchical, with devils climbing in levels of status by performing deeds of great evil, daemons and other residents of Gehenna gravitate toward their roles, choosing that which most satiates their wicked desires. No particular group will admit to being "lesser" than another, and fights often erupt between them. The roles include watchers, whisperers, mercenaries, and servitors, and they are all described in their respective sections in this chapter.
</p>
<p id="page35p12" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Indeed, the inhabitants of Gehenna are more uni-fied by their circles and stations than by their kind. It is more likely that a daemon watcher of the Circle of
Greed will associate with a fallen celestial mercenary of the same circle than another daemon from the Circle

<p id="page35p13" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
of Sloth. Within each circle, stations are considered the most important indicator of association. Watchers band together against whisperers, whisperers against servi- tors, and so on down the line. But when a circle is pitted against another circle or against invading outsiders, all inhabitants band together to overthrow their enemies.

More than any other plane, Gehenna has strong ties to the mortal world, largely because daemons revel in the wickedness and corruption they observe there. Such is this connection that mortals cast shadows upon Gehenna, dark stains resembling their general forms. The greater their wickedness, the darker the shadows become and the more watchers come to bear witness to the deeds and record them in their dark ledgers, until such time that the mortals have accrued corruption enough to be taken.

Where the watchers observe, the whisperers goad, urging souls to walk even deeper into darkness and commit graver and graver sins. Whisperers are the voices people hear in their hearts, urging them to embrace their self-in- terest and choose evil over good. They come to know what tempts mortals personally, what they respond to and what they desire; they grow skilled at steering people toward that which they know is worst for them.

Much as souls condemned to the Abyss become manes and those condemned to Hell become lemures, souls cast or dragged into Gehenna transform into wretched things called thralls, whose form and nature vary depending on the circle in which they become imprisoned. Thralls face a terrible existence in their realms, often trampled, beaten, tortured, or devoured by other daemons. Given the wickedness of sentient creatures in the Material Plane, however, there is no shortage of fresh replacements to fill the Seven-Circle Realm.

Whisperers and watchers come to know their subjects over the years. On rare occasions, their hunger for these souls grows great enough to pull them from
Gehenna into the Material Plane. Once freed, they become terrible threats to those they have observed and whispered to. They know every sin—great and small—and absolutely use this knowledge against their foes if they can. Unlike the fiends of Hell and the Abyss, these daemons of Gehenna are personal horrors and have been known to reduce the most perfect paladin to tears. They know what their targets have been thinking, what they have done in private, and what they are most ashamed of, for they have been with them their entire lives.
The transition from Gehenna to the Material Plane is nothing the daemons can do willingly or under their own power. Instead, they transport themselves when the strength of their desire equals the depth of their subject's wickedness. Daemons in the Material Plane remain there for as long as their subject lives or until they themselves are destroyed. Once they kill their subjects, they return to Gehenna, dragging the captive souls with them.

Gehenna has a keen interest in the fighting between demons and devils. So long as they wage war against each other, neither has time or attention for Gehenna. The exarchs wel- come the armies of each rival plane to conduct their battles in the war zone and even offer up the services of their own warriors to lend aid, for a price. Mercenaries happily serve any employer able to pay them, though their prices are rarely easily paid with gold and are usually tied to the circle of their origin. When not selling themselves to some crazed demon lord or another ambitious infernal aristocrat, the mercenaries protect their circles—the only time they will fight for free.

Over the eons, mortals have learned spells to summon members of the company to do their bidding. A captain, if summoned, will bring several of their underlings with them—once the hiring price has been agreed upon. As below in Gehenna, so it is on the Material Plane: the cost of hiring the Companions is prohibitive and never as simple as gold changing hands.

Scholars cannot determine just how vast the ranks of the
Companions of Malice are, though most agree it is at least
20,000 soldiers strong. The basic soldier of this merce-nary army is the footman. Footmen comprise two kinds of daemons: long-time inhabitants of Gehenna recently indoctrinated in the company and newly arrived souls of neutral evil mortals who, for reasons known only to
Tyrexxus, are sent to the company.
</p>
<p id="page37p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
When a footman has served long enough, they might challenge their commander, a lieutenant, in an effort to achieve higher rank. This challenge, always martial, continues until one of the daemons surrenders. For the lieutenant, surrender is without consequence—the com- pany does not call for the death of its valued commanders unless they fail in their duty. For the footman, surrender is usually punished by becoming that unit's "banner" for a time: the footman is impaled on the banner pole, run through from stem to sternum. Every day, the lieutenant cuts the footman's belly open and its fellow foot- men feed upon its intestines, which lends them the strength of its essence.
</p>
<p id="page37p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The lieutenants are made into captains at the plea-sure of the lord commander of the Companions.
Captains, who command masses of footmen and lieuten-ants, are chosen for their cunning, tactical genius, and love of carnage. Most captains serve in this capacity for the remainder of their existence, though some are selected to serve the lord commander person- ally or even to become a part of Tyrexxus's honor guard.

When mortals thirst for violent revenge as a way to resolve some profound wrong—the murder of a loved one or a deep, personal humiliation—the harbingers of vengeance take note. They can see the fire that burns in mortals' bellies for revenge, and they stoke that flame, whisper- ing revenge is not only a right but also an imperative that must be fulfilled. The harbingers move men to kill the children of those who killed their own children. If a member of a northern tribe hurts a member of a southern tribe, the harbingers are there, telling the southerner that all northerners must pay.
</p>
<p id="page39p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
When mortals finally lay hands on their enemies, when the urge to kill grows strongest, when the need for res- olution chases all other thoughts from their heads, the harbingers shout at the mortals to strike—to maim or kill in payment for the pain and suffering they have had to endure. Usually, they are heeded; mortal souls are weak,
</p>
<p id="page39p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
and revenge is their most easily and commonly committed sin. Harbingers are happy in their duty and richly success- ful, the envy of the seven circles for the ease of their task.
Yet one thing moves them to an unspeakable fury and a desire for revenge of their own: mercy.
</p>
<p id="page39p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
When mortals find themselves in that moment of revenge, their shadows goaded by the harbingers, and they decide not to strike but to forgive, it so infuriates the harbingers that they are sometimes known to journey into the Material Plane to take revenge themselves. They hunt down the criminal who was forgiven and commit unspeakable acts to exact the vengeance that was improp- erly denied. Then they seek the merciful mortal out to pull the weakness of mercy from the mortal's soul with their hands. They never rest until they have succeeded in destroying both victim and criminal or until they them- selves are destroyed.

Fire wreathes the stokers' bodies, growing in intensity when they witness acts of anger. The more violence they cause, the greater the flames. After witnessing the most terrible acts of anger, stokers have been known to send flames shooting up hundreds of feet from their bodies, throwing them to skitter down the broken streets of their wicked realm.
</p>
<p id="page41p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Life presents many stresses, situations any would find frus-trating. When something you need breaks, when a friend fails to follow through or a job on which you were depend- ing goes up in smoke, frustration and anger are completely understandable. Yet for some, these disappointments and setbacks merely stoke the fires of anger, building the flames up until the fires roar inside them. And when the pressure grows too great, they snap, usually with tragic results.
</p>
<p id="page41p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Stokers are fiery daemons who gather around the shad-ows of mortals who have time and time again overreacted to the difficulties of life. They whisper to these shadows, mocking their upset over these challenges in hopes of driv- ing them to wild and reckless action. They chortle with glee when the objects of their attention lash out with violence over the most trivial matters and sigh with pleasure when lives break, relationships fall apart, and ruin follows.
</p>
<p id="page41p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Stokers react quite strongly when denied the pleasure they take from observing violent action and rage about if their subject somehow ignores their prodding and keeps control.
If the individual is one who has often given in to rage and yet holds back, the stokers might slip into the Material
Plane and do the violence themselves, murdering loved ones, destroying property, and generally ruining everything before they return to their shadows and dark ledgers.

Wrath is the most spectacular of mortal sins, for it is easily the most demonstrative and has the most profound results.
Anger is common, something almost every person with a personality is bound to experience. But when anger leads to the harm of an innocent—someone undeserving of the attack—simple anger becomes a mortal sin. Through cut- ting words or physical violence, the mortal's shadow grows a little darker and a little longer in Gehenna.
</p>
<p id="page42p28" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Inciters watch over the shadows of the wrathful, cat-aloging each sin born from anger in Tyrexxus's Circle of
Wrath. Each time a mortal gives in to the hate burning in their heart, the inciters raucously applaud and cele- brate while quickly recording the misdeed. Their favorite failings are those when an innocent is harmed through unchecked emotions and raw violence, and they feed on the hatred of this mortal servant. As more and more misdeeds occur, the inciters grow more excited, until they reach the apex of their stimulation, when they travel to the Material Plane to snatch the angry mortal and bring them back to Gehenna, where the inciters each take a turn brutally torturing the mortal until the evil energies

If a particularly exciting mortal repents their ways,
</p>
<p id="page42p30" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
gaining control over their emotions, the inciters grow frustrated, shrieking so loud the echoes of their cries travel throughout Tyrexxus's realm. In their frustration, they turn on one another, which, if nothing else, keeps the number of inciters from growing out of control. Once they cool off, the inciters journey to the Material Plane to disrupt the mortal's life, ruining their target's work, planting false evidence of a spouse's infidelity, and doing anything else that might provoke their victim to acts of fearsome violence. If the mortal continues to resist the daemons' manipulations, the inciters take a more direct role and start killing the mortal's family and friends, utterly ruining their victim's life in their revenge.

As a creature of wrath, he is consumed with hatred for his enemies, seeking to break not just their bodies but their spirits as well.

When Gehenna was new, several demon lords came to the Circle of Wrath, demanding that Tyrexxus surrender all his lands to them. One of these lords, Zhar'Ub-Luur, greatest liar among all demonkind, told Tyrexxus's ser- vants they would be taken to the Abyss and forced for eternity to consume the excrement of Demogorgon if they continued to support their exarch—and so great was his skill in trickery that nearly all believed him.
The entire circle prepared to revolt against the master of wrath, save one.

U'ulgan, a creature of seemingly boundless rage, was discovered to have one other trait: loyalty. So fierce was his loyalty to his exarch that before the rebellion could begin, as Zhar'Ub-Luur spoke to the servants of the circle, U'ulgan leapt upon him for daring to threaten his master. Zhar'Ub-Luur, a lord of trickery, was not pre- pared for the force of this lesser creature's onslaught and was caught at a disadvantage.

It is said that wrath's influence on the mortal world is best captured in the existence of lycanthropes, for they clearly represent the beast inside all. They are the monsters lurk- ing in every man and woman and horrifying depictions of the classical struggle with human morality. When a mortal gives in to anger and violence, for a moment, something primal, something bestial, emerges in their features. And in this emergence is the horror of raw, unchecked violence born.

The vecrose watch mortals lapsing into anger and vio-lence, cataloging every incident and triumphing as the mortals' souls grow darker with the stain. Unlike the other watchers of wrath, these daemons are concerned with the prolonged release of anger, the extent of the duration and the effects on those around the offending mortal. Simple outbursts of violence are interesting, but the longer tirades are what excite the vecrose. The greater the destruction and the more lives ruined, the better.

Mortals whose wrath is so capricious and misdi-rected as to alienate them from their societies are those most beloved by the vecrose. These mortals, driven to despair by their loneliness, touch a special chord with these monsters. The daemons take pity on the suffering and pay a special visit to their favored sinners. On the
Material Plane, they search out the exile and give them a gift, transforming them into a particularly violent lycanthrope, such as a werewolf or wereboar. They then take the mortal back to civilization, preferably to where their family resides, on the night of a full moon and release the twisted monster among the unsuspecting vic- tims. The vecrose watch and record the events, clapping each other on the back as the violence escalates, until the community finally rallies and kills the threat. The vecrose always hurry back to Gehenna to greet and con- gratulate the damned spirit before sending them off to their own eternal punishment.

A former lover who is now in the arms of another or a bitter rival who receives a promotion are just two examples of events that can result in violence committed in envy's name.

<p id="page51p29" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
One does well to ignore the sweet blandishments, the enticing offers heard from the shifting shadows on the road to the Circle of Envy, for they invariably come from one of Ulasta's greatest servants, Mother Igwyre, the Ser- vitor of Envy. A spiderlike being with the head of a nasty old woman, the daemon has bloated to incredible size and lures her victims into her webs through whispered temp- tations that flit through the air on wings of her hatred.
To succumb to them, to set foot into her tangled lair, is to find a horrid end.

Long ago, a pious midwife named Igwyre prayed to the gods to grant her many children. And because she had always been faithful and good, they did. She was mother to seven boys and seven girls, and each of her children bore the grace of the gods. They were mighty, wise, and fair.

Her refusal of the comfort of Heaven saddened the gods, but still they forgave her. They never foresaw the path she would choose in the depths of her despair and so ceased to be concerned with her, believing she would find joy when death came to her and she was reunited with her kin.
</p>
<p id="page52p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Igwyre was not only consumed by despair, though. She began to feel a burning hatred in her heart for all those women she had aided in the birthing of their children—a deep and unshakable envy. She believed their children, who were not so blessed by the gods, would not be drawn into lives of great deeds and so would not die so young.
</p>
<p id="page52p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The daemons of envy observed the shadow of this kind woman now falling faster and faster into the depths of sin.
They whispered to her in her sleep and in her waking hours, telling her she was right to hate those women whose babies lived and that she should teach them a lesson.

<p id="page52p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
And so Igwyre, who wept morning, noon, and night, began to secretly skulk about her village at night, watch- ing the children and recording the patterns of their daily lives. Over the course of a month, she laid traps and other horrors for these children, such as a poisonous viper in a favorite place of play or a jutting and filthy spike in the waters where they jumped and swam. To the villagers it seemed a horrible curse had befallen them as their chil- dren were suddenly crippled and killed at an alarming rate. No one suspected the weeping midwife of the crimes, and they began to pray to the Lords of Good to forgive

Igwyre's eldest son and daughter were killed opposing the forces of evil, the family wept, but none were dissuaded from the path of righteousness. With each passing year, more of
Igwyre's children were killed, until, at the end of a decade of tragedy, all of her progeny were dead and gone.

<p id="page52p17" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
At the death of her youngest and last living child, Igwyre climbed atop the funereal mound and cursed the gods. They had granted her fourteen glorious children and then chosen to strip that glory from her. And though it is a terrible sin to curse the gods, the hearts of Heaven were moved. The
Lords of Good sent the archangel Rafaiil to earth to com-fort Igwyre, saying "Know thee, Igwyre, that each of your children sits upon a golden throne in Heaven this hour.
There is a place for thee at their table." But Igwyre only wept—and her weeping never ceased in her mortal life.

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the ruin. A creature that chooses not to be pushed or can't be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.
On a failed save, the ruin enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage and is partially absorbed. A partially absorbed creature is restrained and takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage plus 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the ruin's turns. When the ruin moves, the absorbed creature moves with it.
An absorbed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 18 Strength check. On a success, the creature takes 7 (2d6) slashing damage, escapes, and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ruin.
An absorbed creature that drops to 0 hit points dies immediately, and its soul is consumed by the ruin in flesh, which prevents the creature from being restored to life by any means short of a wish spell. The ruin in flesh regains 18 (4d8) hit points after consuming a soul.

Prior to their existence as weeping coils, these daemons were once mortals, who, through their dissatisfaction and envy of others, destroyed themselves with sin. These individuals stand apart from others condemned to the
Circle of Envy in that the results of their wickedness cost not only their own lives but those of countless innocents.
Some were the offspring of regents, who murdered their way to the throne only to find they had plunged their nations into chaos. Others were powerful students of magic, who, desperate to overtake their rivals, destroyed themselves and innumerable lives in magical conflagra- tions. Gehenna rewards such fools with even greater suffering and transformed them into abominations con- demned to watch others find the same fate.

Far beneath the tawdry streets of the Circle of Lust stretches a range of tunnels that plunge into the fetid depths of Gehenna. In these slick caverns, down which drain the foul excretions spilled by those enslaved to their carnal lusts and condemned to spend eternity among the riotous mob of hedonists sworn to serve their vile exarch, can be found the most debased of daemons and souls alike.
Their interests go far beyond the realm of pleasure and pain.
Their cravings exceed the imaginations of the most dia-bolical minds, and witnessing the acts performed in these gloomy passages invites incurable madness. Even if the denizens knew limits to their hideous cravings, they would push past them; such is the influence of In'nassi's terrible servitor Aezidion, known as the Desire Made Flesh.

Few have ever spied Aezidion in its true form, since the daemon forms its flesh into whatever shape visitors desire most, but behind these enticing facades lies a monstrosity of staggering proportion, a veritable sea of undulating flesh, pocked with glistening orifices that pucker and yawn to release plumes of stupefying mist. Between the treacherous pits dimpling the fleshy expanse bulge great, shuddering eyes that roll about in a mockery of ecstasy.

Lords of Good and seduced the deity. The fruit of their union quickened in In'nassi's womb, and not long after, she gave birth to a tide of horrors that would become the daemons dwelling in her circle. After the final fiend pulled itself free, she gave one final heave, pushing out a noxious slick of slime and fluid, in which swam misshapen bits. The effluvia drained into the passages below her palace, where they gathered in a deep cave. Such was the divine nature of this afterbirth that it soon after gained awareness, identity, and purpose, which was to sample

Many mortals seek to fill the hollow sense of loneliness that haunts them with the body of another.

The pleasure amorines take from bearing witness to lustful acts whips them into a frenzy of desire, and an individual worm slithers free from the mass, using the mortal's sin as a gateway for its intrusion into the Material Plane.
Venturing from Gehenna, the worm incubates within the sinner's body. Each time the mortal gives in to tempta- tion, committing an act of lust, the amorine grows a little larger, until, when fully grown—about three feet long—it emerges from its host, which is always an extremely pain- ful event that leaves its host gasping. The daemon's first act upon escaping the flesh is to devour its host while they are most vulnerable.

its telepathy. Constructs, elementals, plants, and undead are immune to this effect. Each target must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or take 18 (4d8) psychic damage. For each creature that takes this damage, Aezidion creates from its own flesh a creature that perfectly matches whatever being the damaged creature desires most. The creation remains until Aezidion uses Desire Revealed again. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw becomes immune to Desire Revealed for 24 hours. While a creature can see the object of its desire, it has disadvantage on all attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
An object of desire created by this effect remains part of Aezidion, though it looks, feels, and sounds exactly like what the target imagines. The object of desire cannot move more than 120 feet away from Aezidion, as several strands of flesh connect it to the daemon's body. These strands are immune to damage but break if there is not a 1-inch-wide opening between the object of desire and Aezidion.

If this damage drops a target to 0 or fewer hit points, the target dies, its body is absorbed by the daemon, and the object of desire disappears. A creature killed in this way cannot be restored to life by any means short of a wish spell.

In Gehenna, the amorines gather themselves into tow-ering humanoid-shaped masses of writhing worms. They creep about the Circle of Lust, inspecting the shadows cast by lustful mortals on the Material Plane and record- ing their deeds on the pages of the dark ledgers carried on the backs of the damned souls condemned to this place.
With each depraved act, each debauched performance, the heap of worms shudders in delight, the worms' filthy excretions falling from it like rain.

An amorine can leave Gehenna to enter the body of any mortal who has gained corruption by indulging in lustful behavior. Constructs, fiends, and undead are immune to this effect. While inside the host body, the amorine can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, other than those that would drive it from the host's body, such as the

Each time the amorine's host finishes a long rest, the amorine wriggles inside the body, forcing the host to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the host gains a new flaw: "I am a slave to my lust and perform any lustful act that I can." The host retains this flaw until they finish a long rest. If the host succeeds on three consecutive Wisdom saving throws, the amorine starves and slides free from the host's body.
</p>
<p id="page59p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
If the host fails three saving throws, the parasite emerges from the target, causing the host to take 2d6 slashing damage and forcing them to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the host becomes stunned for 1 minute. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns and ends the effect on itself with a success. Regardless, the amorine rolls initiative with advantage and takes the next available turn to attack its host.

Eunuchs gain hollow satisfaction by piercing their victims' bodies with their razor-sharp horns. Each time these daemons rupture a soft belly and intestines, they snarl with malice. Pain is the only sensation left to them, and they are eager to share it. Each eunuch possesses a diseased, biting tentacle that bursts from its abdomen to strike foes in the belly, where the tentacle disgorges writhin maggots into its prey. The vermin's eating softens the victim's flesh, easing the penetration of the eunuch's horns. As this horrific and malicious act allows eunuchs to share a fraction of the agony of their own creation, pro- viding an intellectual pleasure in place of the lusts they are forever denied, they are always eager for battle.

The fate awaiting those who choose only carnal desires over compassion and respect in life is to be cast to the realm of daemons in death. The lustful are made from souls condemned to the Circle of Lust, where the souls become transformed into bizarre distortions of their former selves. Their attractive and repellent qualities manifest in their forms to broadcast those desires that led them to their dooms. Their desire for sexual satisfaction magnifies into an unquenchable thirst that drives them to misery and wanton acts in an attempt to slake their gnaw- ing withdrawal—but they cannot take what they want, only beg for release.

Daemons join the lustful in an array of carnal and other sense-shredding acts that are unequaled in their extremity and diversity. As extreme as these indulgences are, they remain cursed to forever deny true pleasure to their par- ticipants. Yet these mechanical sensations have a certain familiarity, a supposed potential to reignite the flame of pleasure, so these acts only inspire further desperate seeking, driving the lustful to even more humiliating and despicable acts. The lustful might plead with travelers, begging for escape, and yet go willingly with a "lover" who comes to call.

In Gehenna, the ograq is assumed to lair in obscure cor-ners of the Circle of Lust, but in truth, it is cursed with intangibility, manifesting as nothing more than a ripple in a humid wind unless a daemon commands it to manifest, or a sinner draws it to the Material Plane. Only then can it appear, a creature composed of violent tentacles and dark, slavering maws.

Certain people who crave carnal pleasures find themselves denied the fulfillment they need and their cravings left unfulfilled. The reasons run the gamut. A scant few suffer some hideous malformation of their features; some find they cannot conceal their desires, their lust naked on their faces; but most simply maintain traits and habits odious to those around them Such individuals, prevented as they are from finding the physical comforts to which they feel enti- tled, must instead watch, gazing on in abject lust, those about them and turn to themselves for some release.

Once they have truly degenerated into stalkers, they attract the attention of the most terrible variety of daemon.

The Circle of Lust is an orgy of perversity, debauchery, and wickedness. The creatures there fornicate in des- peration, never gaining satisfaction from their appetites.
Fueling their wanton behavior is the exarch who lords over this realm, exuding the same degree of sick desires as her minions. Of all the creatures here, it is In'nassi who is the most fecund, coupling some thirty times in a day. The petty offspring of In'nassi's unions are called uncs.

A lesser restoration spell ends this effect on an affected creature. If the creature is paralyzed the full time, the creature takes 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and gives birth to a vlogar (see Vlogar, later in this section). The vlogar immediately grows from small to medium size and stands up in the creature's space, rolls initiative, and typically attacks its host when it takes its turn.

Some mortals cannot be satisfied with the spiritless cou-plings of the lustful. They must exert further egotsical satisfaction and a sense of control over those they desire.
These sinners are not only voyeurs, but braggarts. They spread rumors of their own assignations and those of others. They portray their own acts as conquests, and their partners as dupes and prey when speaking of encounters both real and imagined. These acts draw the attention of volgars, who encourage the sinner to become the vilest sorts of slanderers and narcissists.
</p>
<p id="page66p33" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The vlogars consider it a great victory when their whis-pers drive mortals to such behaviors. Every night that mortals partake in these actions, the vlogars grow stron- ger. But sometimes a vlogar's accomplishment is upended.
If the mortal in question is rebuked and humiliated for their sins, or otherwise ceases to engage in this loathsome behavior, the vlogar becomes infuriated, having grown accustomed to the power given it by the sin of its charge.
</p>
<p id="page66p34" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
In these times, the vlogar might come to the Material
Plane and do whatever it must to ensure that the behavior continues. If the mortal in question has simply stopped behaving in this manner, the vlogar will force them to resume. If the mortal has been imprisoned, banished, or otherwise prevented from indulging in their sins, the vlogar might slaughter all interlopers to ensure their favored subjects can resume their vile hobbies.

When a particularly cherished dream is forgotten by one of its subjects, sometimes the abandoned dream finds its way to the Material Plane by the power of that loss.
There it becomes the embodiment of the dream, haunt-ing and tormenting the dreamer with regret. Perhaps the dreamer is a poor mother who gave up on a better life for her child. In such a case, the abandoned dream will come to her at her lowest and offer her a hand up for her child— an apprenticeship, schooling, and future riches—only to withdraw the offer at the eleventh hour.

Much as they did before being condemned to Gehenna, indolents find it difficult to care about or do much of anything, preferring to pass their time doing nothing, slipping in and out of a sleep they can never quite shake off. Indolents litter the Circle of Sloth, their bodies lying wherever they appeared. If disturbed, they can rouse themselves with great effort, but they do so for short peri- ods, until the need for rest overtakes them once more.

Indolents pose little danger to other creatures, provided they are left alone. If approached, though, their lethargy radiates from them in a palpable aura that drains away all intent and leaves the creature in desperate need of rest.
Indolents caress creatures they put to sleep, each touch building the creatures' exhaustion until they slip into comas from which they can never awaken.

humanoid creature it has grappled. The languishing contests a Strength check against the target's Strength check. On a success, the languishing pops the creature's head from its body and devours its jaw.
A target that loses its head in this way remains alive, but its body is blinded and deafened, though the target can still see and hear in regard to its head's position. Lacking a head prevents the target from speaking, which makes it impossible for the target to speak the verbal components of spells or command words for magic items it might possess. Furthermore, lacking orifices with which to eat or drink could result in the death of the body.
Whether or not the body dies, the head lives on in a state of continually deepening horror up to its normal life expectancy and without needing to eat or drink. A detached head has an AC 0 and 5 hit points. The head knows everything it knew before its separation, though its options, including those related to the lack of a jaw, are quite limited in this new divided state.
A detached head can be rejoined to the body by placing it on the neck stump and casting a heal spell and a regenerate spell on the target.
If the body or head dies, the divided creature cannot be restored to life and wholeness until both parts have died.

Mortal life is so filled with tragedy it is a wonder the poor folk who must endure it do not spend their every hour weeping.

And he would be intent on recapturing his throne. Such an eventuality would indeed be grim for the world.

Whenever good heroes of considerable ability contemplate abandoning years of work helping others to help only themselves, they cast deep shadows in the Circle of Sloth.
There they are observed by the daemons of slumbering valor, who whisper to the shadows, encouraging the erst- while heroes to set aside their burdens.

Those heroes who listen and pursue paths of selfishness become tied to the daemons of slumbering valor that whispered to them. The daemons continue to observe the mortals' descent into sloth, delighting at their every act of brazen self-interest.

Viasta has little interest in anything happening in or around his domain. He lies in a torpid slumber, rarely shifting, never speaking, and offering no direction to the daemons that serve him. While he is oblivious to the world around him, small seedlings find purchase in his skin. In time, they root in his flesh and grow, feeding upon the nourishing daemonic blood, sweat, and flesh.

But Yungo and his more powerful servants can no longer digest what they consume. For too many years they have feasted on their own dross, ruining themselves. For this reason, the feastings were brought to the circle. These parasites live within Yungo's stomach and the endless miles of his intestines. There they eat the half-digested food (and the still-living unfortunate creatures) recently swallowed by their master.

The feastings also reside in the bellies of Yungo's greater servitors. When in battle, these daemons sometimes vomit up a horde of feastings all over their foe. The feastings exist to consume everything they can and are able to tear apart a Medium-sized creature in under a minute. It is for this reason that demons and devils steer clear of the Circle of Gluttony.

The foul daemons capering and crawling across Yungo's corpulence revel in their disgusting environment. They bathe in pools of glistening sweat, greedily suck down saliva and vomit dripping from their master's mouth, and prowl widely for the choice bits that have somehow escaped Yungo's maw.

Flabules have little in the way of independent will and actually enjoy their work of gathering up the miss- ing meals for themselves, thanks to their inner hunger imprinted by Yungo. No flabule is aware of its fate, though when their day of reckoning does arrive, they deem it an honor to be devoured by their god. Occasionally, a flabule winds up in the Material Plane, where it feeds and feeds, growing larger and larger until it bursts, unable to make it back to its foul master.

Like lice, the hunger crawl all over the molten mounds of flesh that are the Circle of Gluttony, in search of the loose bits of tissue that the exarch misses in his own constant search for food. They exist in the greatest concentrations near Yungo's mouth. The slow ones are captured by Yungo's tongue and dragged shrieking to the fetid depths of his gizzard to join the countless other swallowed creatures writhing in an eternity of feastings and slow-acting acids.

Death does nothing to lift the cravings that so afflicted the damned in life. When the Circle of Gluttony claims the souls of gluttonous mortals, those beings find they can think of nothing other than feeding their horrid hunger and thus gorge themselves on whatever they find. They eat the living and the dead, they slide offal into their gullets, and, if need be, they gobble up their excrement. Most hungry fight among themselves for the choicest bits, and their snarls and barks recall the sound of jackals fighting over their kills. Only when presented with fresh meat do they turn from their horrid squabbling and rush forward to be the first to claim their victims.

All hunger in the Circle of Gluttony. Nothing consumed is ever enough; nothing devoured ever satiates the burn- ing, wrenching feeling of emptiness that haunts the daemons of this realm. Although the task of all watchers is to observe mortals indulging in their sins, the krobu- lons do so with great frustration, for they feel the pangs of hunger more keenly than any other fiend in Yun- go's dominion.

Deprived of orifices, the only relief they experience is when they observe mortals in the act of feeding themselves to excess, especially when doing so deprives others of the sustenance they need to survive. Normally, krobulons look like skeletons clothed in a leathery tarp, but as they observe, the darkness they absorb fills them, gradually expanding their leathery skin until they balloon outward, waddling around the shadows that darken in their midst. However, if they absorb too much evil, they explode, showering everything nearby with their hid- eous filth.

Mortals who break these barriers, sampling forbidden delights without thought for what they eat, are certain to attract the attention of the paesods. These daemons search the Material Plane and offer quiet suggestions, implanting urges to consume more and more strange and unwholesome things. Such deviations may include eating forbidden flesh, such as scavenger animals or even worse.
Later, at the urgings of the paesod, the mortal may start eating their neighbor's pets, horrible insects, and other unsavory things. Finally, their true corruption takes hold when feasting upon the flesh of sentient creatures and undead, harvesting their bodies to fulfill an unholy hunger implanted by these daemons.

Not all sins of gluttony involve the gorging of oneself on food, ravenously devouring all there is. Most moral lapses simply involve minor sins, like sneaking into the larder to steal an extra bite of food, depriving another of their supplies, or stuffing oneself during an exquisite meal. But the idea of consumption itself has another aspect most mortals ignore.

Consumption always involves the deprivation of the life of one in exchange for the survival of another.

However, there are those mortals with plenty who not only overindulge but also do so willfully, refusing to share with those they can plainly see are starving. The fat landowner who takes all the grain from the impoverished farmers who work their land, letting the farmers starve while they surfeit is a prime example.
</p>
<p id="page83p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
These mortals are favorites of the Circle of Gluttony, and their sin is cultivated over many years. They are watched and whispered to every day, told they are justi- fied in their refusal to share no matter what anyone says.
And when the mortals die, they become the meals of the wugarts.
</p>
<p id="page83p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The wugarts watch the shadows of these mortals in their lifetimes, growing hungrier and hungrier with each passing day, anticipating the day one of these mortals will pass and come to Gehenna. When that day comes, the wugart feasts. Every day, the mortal is torn apart slowly with silver cutlery or whatever finery was the symbol of the mortal's overindulgence in life. The sinner is kept alive through the entire process, experiencing their kidneys being plucked from their bodies and watching as the kidneys are popped into the wugart's maw and chewed with relish. When at last every bone, organ, and drop of blood is consumed, the wugart expels the parts, and the mortal is re-formed from the beast's excrement. And so it goes for eternity.

A favorite among summoners and those who would make bargains with the evil realms of the outer planes, Zovarik is a powerful servant of Yungo. Having resided in Gehenna for millennia, he has traded knowledge with creatures from nearly every plane. In his time, he has swallowed countless treasures, perhaps even a few arti- facts, and they still reside in his gullet.
</p>
<p id="page83p6" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Often, he is called to answer questions that cannot be answered by any other means. His price is very simple: he accepts only payment that he may eat, and it must come from the flesh or soul of his summoner. Nothing else will please his palate, which has grown jaded over the years.
</p>
<p id="page83p7" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
For knowledge, he requires a bite from the flesh of the summoner; usually he takes a hand or an entire arm, depending on the knowledge. This must be torn from the body by his teeth, not prepared beforehand—he is quite picky. For more powerful requests, he requires a sizable bite from a mortal's soul, taking and consuming forever a part of the summoner's essence.
</p>
<p id="page83p8" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Zovarik is exceedingly clever and always hungry. While it is very difficult to trick him, he will accept all sorts of appetizers if offered in an effort to talk him out of his price.

The daemon now controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The daemon can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
At the end of each of the target's turns, it must succeed on a
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by 10 (3d6). The reduction lasts until the creature is no longer possessed and finishes a long rest. If the reduction drops the creature's hit point maximum to 0, the creature dies and disappears, along with the daemon, into Gehenna.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the daemon ends it as a bonus action, or the daemon is somehow forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the hoarder reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this daemon's

The hoarders observe the misers, the obscenely selfish, and the wealthy that refuse to give even a dented copper piece to charitable causes. They congregate in the Circle of Greed and whisper among themselves, furious at every outrageous act. For it is their belief that all of this wealth collected by mortals belongs to them. All the treasure in the world, the hoarders believe, was stolen from them in time immemorial. So it is that nothing angers the hoarders more thoroughly than mortals who take and take, hoarding their possessions with the belief that these things are theirs in the first place.
</p>
<p id="page86p27" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
The rage of the hoarders is generally impotent. They watch, muttering and spitting, banging their horns against one another in a cacophony of ineffectual indignation.
There are treasures, however, that are tied to the hoarders,

"Before our eyes, Tevy began to stoop, her back cracking and creaking as though she were being bent forward by an invisible, mighty hand. Her skin grew hard, like stone, and from her face sprouted tusks and crude ornamentations of horn and tooth. Her hands shattered and re-formed as fleshy mitts, no more capable of grasping the coin she had been reaching for than of plucking forth a tune from a harp. Her greed had ruined her before our eyes."

ranging from small baubles to legendary artifacts. Perhaps these are the real treasures of their past, actually taken from them long ago.
</p>
<p id="page86p31" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
If one of the world's greedier mortals seeks to take one of these treasures and keep it for themselves (as, perhaps, a rogue might slip a loose coin in their pocket, think- ing no one will notice—but all such acts are noticed in
Gehenna), the hoarders to whom the treasure is tied are free to enter the Material Plane. When this happens, quite often the person lifting the treasure is transformed into a hoarder.
</p>
<p id="page86p32" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Often only a single hoarder comes. But the strength of the treasure's tie to them will bring more. Curiously, this tie is not proportional to the value of the treasure. A great work of art stolen by a greedy thief may draw only one hoarder, whereas a beaten-up old coin lying on the road may draw a horde. Some speculate that it is not the strength of the tie between the treasure and the daemons that draws them—it is the profundity of the act of greed committed by the mortal.

Many of Mytaxx's most powerful servants are depraved and wicked undead, beings of pure spite and malevolence that desire nothing more than to consume the life of a mortal.
Most of the horrors serve as commanders of her daemons who perform the majority of the fighting alongside the lesser undead. The most powerful of these daemons are the mockeries in flame—horrific daemons bred to hold the life-leeching power of the Negative Energy Plane.

Ulasta employs mockeries to steal and capture the life energies of wicked and jealous mortals and return them to her so that one day she might attain her goal to become a living woman. The mockeries, who serve the commands of the watchers, stand ready to fight and drain away the energy of living things for their dark mistress.

Misers wander the endless passages that form a labyrinth around Mytaxx's vault. Once mortals who lived lives con- sumed by avarice, they tumbled into Gehenna in death, where they are condemned to covet what they cannot have. They cling to the worthless trinkets and baubles they find, stroking them and mewling to them. While much of what these wretched daemons have is worthless, some- times a miser manages to find something of true value.

The possessed creature retains control over its body, but it makes attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws with disadvantage until the possession ends. While possessing the target, the remnant can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect.
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the remnant ends it as a bonus action, or the remnant is forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the remnant reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to this remnant's possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
Whenever a possessed target finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw, with a -2 penalty to the roll for each remnant inside its body beyond the first. On a failed save, the target loses control of its body for 1d6 hours, during which time the target becomes incapacitated. The remnant controls the target's body, using the body's statistics but retaining its own alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. If the target succeeds on this saving throw, one remnant possessing it leaves the target's body as described previously.

mindlessly for a time in Gehenna. The exarchs absorb most of the loose essences, breathing the mists of these incorporeal forms into their own corrupt bodies, savor- ing the suffering of all. A few, however, escape ultimate consumption and exist in a quasi-real state, eventually developing a new personality and motivation. These ghostly daemons are the remnants.
</p>
<p id="page91p25" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Two overriding interests drive remnants. First, these daemons yearn to be free from the inevitable consump- tion they face if they remain in Gehenna. Second, they desperately want a body to occupy. These ends often come together, for the remnants can occupy a host creature, which allows them the means to escape their doom. How- ever, when the remnant seizes control over a host body, the body's movements are slow, appearing as a zombie.
For these reasons, exarchs command their mercenaries to hunt free-willed undead, tear them to pieces, and see if those vessels hide any surprises inside.
</p>
<p id="page91p26" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
One exarch, however, sees value in these detached dae-mons. Mytaxx, hording his own treasures and resources, would rather rely on humanoid servants to serve as his army. Mytaxx's minions sometimes kidnap mortal vessels and expose them to remnants, who quickly take pos- session of the bodies. The newly possessed function as zombie servants, serving the whims of the Golden Miser.

Mytaxx, exarch of the Circle of Greed, took special interest in this dragon. He was attracted to her incal- culable avarice, all committed in the name of good.
Forbidding any of his minions from touching her, he per-sonally whispered to the dragon, urging her to weed out the corrupt from within the ranks of her own kind, con- vincing her that their wealth would add nicely to her own and she was preventing its taint from ever touching mortal hands. In time, the seductive voice of greed wormed into her heart, and, in secret, she ambushed her brothers and sisters, betraying them for their treasure.

Nothing personifies greed more than dragons. Certainly, many mortals confuse the virtue of frugality with miser- liness, and dwarves have a nearly unwholesome lust for bright veins of ore imprisoned beneath the bones of the earth. But dragons hoard whatever they can, gathering coin, gems, magical relics, and anything else they deem of value in their lairs. This penchant for greed is not exclusive to just the chromatic dragons, for, in fact, it extends to dragons of all types and colors. One such dragon, famous for her corruption, was Draqolath the Gold.
</p>
<p id="page92p33" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Draqolath's greed began as any other dragon's instinc-tual need to accumulate wealth and hide it away in a deep and well-protected lair. She, like her kin, sacked the lairs of other dragons, preying upon the evil types exclusively.
Her zeal in combating the sons and daughters of evil dragons was greater than that of her kin, though, and

bask in their inspired attentions and hoard them like her many other treasures. Sensing the value of living treasure, Draqolath kidnapped a mortal village and forced them to occupy her caves. In her madness, she saw these mortals as objects of utility and pleasure, not recognizing their essential needs, such as food and water.
</p>
<p id="page93p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Over time, the torment of the captives drove most to madness and cannibalism. They set upon one another like wild beasts. Draqolath, believing their acts an homage to her nigh divinity, encouraged such activities, pitting one faction against another in her massive network of treasure-filled caves. Eventually, the last tortured victim of her greed died of starvation, and with so many murders staining the once-good dragon's soul, Mytaxx fetched her himself, dragging her bloated form screaming to the wastes of his personal circle.
</p>
<p id="page93p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Draqolath lives to this day, but only as the object of
Mytaxx's own limitless greed. She is so ancient now she can do nothing else but lie there and birth her warped and twisted brood, fathered by Mytaxx. These pathetic, mewling creatures are stunted and lack the true power expected from a dragon-daemon crossbreed.
In contempt, Mytaxx named these creatures the spawn of Draqolath, keeping their true names for himself. Serving him as sol- diers to launch counteroffensives against those that would invade the exarch's realm, these creatures have no sense of identity and exist merely to serve.

When great mortals, celebrated as champions of righ-teousness by their peers, begin to believe themselves beyond evil, the forces of pride converge on them, encour- aging thoughts of purity, telling them that they have rid themselves of the last vestiges of temptation.

All mortals are guilty of sin. This is a truth as old as the mortal races. Yet there are those among the mortal races who believe they have cleansed themselves of all wick- edness and made themselves into pure beings who are beyond evil.

In these cases, mortals might become so convinced of their purity that they grow completely blind to their sins, no matter how obvious they are to others. These individ- uals become beacons of pride and are often inhabited by one of the whispering daemons of Gehenna. When this happens, the daemon resides within the mortal, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal itself. When the mortal makes some invocation of purity or commits some partic- ularly obvious act of sin without heeding it or feeling the slightest remorse for it, the daemon bursts forth, granting the mortal exactly what they wish.

Braggarts are common. Many see themselves as the best their culture can create, fully versed in a number of lan- guages or skills, or the best at a particular profession or some other role. Some mortals can be gratuitous in their display of wealth and privilege, while others wear scan- dalous clothing to reveal the perfection of their bodies.
Regardless of how pride manifests, glomerays love these mortals best, and their whispers drive the prideful to their destruction.

Glomerays encourage bad behavior by clustering around the shadows cast in their circle. They urge their targets to be proud of their accomplishments, to bask in their achievements, and to take their rightful place in their societies. Simple pride in one's work is nothing if no one knows how good you really are. Of course, boasts and brags tend to isolate these individuals, as other mortals rarely suffer such behavior for long. With their targets iso- lated, the glomerays seize more control over these mortals, further alienating them from others, until such time that despair sets in. The glomerays feel they have done their jobs well when the mortals commit suicide.

In the refined Circle of Pride, the kurgel gather in the

When mortals consider themselves above others due to intelligence or cunning, the sin of their pride casts shad- ows among the kurgel. There, in their dark ledgers, the kurgel record the sins, convinced that they themselves are the wisest, most brilliant beings in all the multiverse.

The kurgel rarely leave the safe harbor of the Circle of

If a mortal comes to believe, even for a moment, that theirs is the greatest mind anywhere in the multiverse, the kurgel start plotting how to teach them a lesson. This may be as simple as arranging their downfall through machinations and schemes, in which the mortal is shown that they are not so clever after all, but it sometimes involves traveling to the
Material Plane to teach the mortal a lesson personally.

They mutter and whine about how they don't belong in Gehenna, that they were great people, and that there must be some mistake, for how else could they be so reduced.

Gravicarius, the exarch of Pride, has the best of everything—
or so it is said. In his collection one might find the swiftest horse in the multiverse, the sharpest blade, the most impreg- nable armor. But his collection also includes his companions, talking and breathing creatures that are the greatest at their pursuits, or so they believe. Of these companions are He and
She, a male and a female, their genders selected to emulate the sibling monarchs of fallen dynasties, who were corrupted by an obsession with the purity of their bloodlines.

As hostile and nasty as the Abyss can be, certain creatures do manage to eke out an existence here, as their natures parallel that of the Abyss itself. These beings, commonly known as demons on the Material Plane, divide themselves into countless races, subraces, and breeds. The greatest demons bend the spirit of the plane itself to their will, becoming self-styled princes of certain layers, dominating hordes of demonic subjects just as human sovereigns com- mand their vassals.
</p>
<p id="page103p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Notoriously disloyal, demons hold true allegiance only to their own chaotic, unpredictable nature. They war against one another, against the devils of the Nine Hells, and against the angelic choirs of the Upper Planes, sacri- ficing themselves without regard for their own well-being as if honoring the very concept of destruction, whether of themselves or their enemies. Despite their propensity to die in huge numbers when facing better-organized foes, the uncountable horde propels the armies of the Abyss to victory as often as not. An infinite plane, after all, can produce an infinite number of demonic soldiers.
</p>
<p id="page103p3" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Yet not all demons prefer the cosmic battlefields of the
Outer Planes. Some delight in tempting mortals to acts of chaos and evil, increasing the number of souls entering the Abyss with every foul corruption. Demon princes require mortal souls to maintain their hold on their per- sonal layers, and their agents roam the physical world in search of converts for their infernal masters.
</p>
<p id="page103p4" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Some demons come to the Material Plane at the behest of amoral wizards, clerics, or sorcerers, who summon them from the Abyss to do their bidding. When under the command of a summoner, demons make powerful shock troops, cunning confidants, and skillful assassins. Certain magical practitioners, warlocks and wizards alike, have developed the practice of manipulating demonic forces and magic to a science. Just as the world has much to offer demons, demons have much to offer it.
</p>
<p id="page103p5" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Even an adherence to chaos and evil, however, allows room for differences. Not all demons exist merely to frighten or eat mortals. Some can make for powerful (albeit very dangerous) allies, approaching an adventur- ing party with offers of mutual assistance. Some portray themselves as misunderstood victims of creation, benevo- lent advocates of philosophies not intrinsically "bad," but simply frowned upon by society at large. In the magical world of a fantasy roleplaying campaign, knowing the difference between a silk-voiced demon who legitimately offers unknown pleasures and one who merely wants to feast on your innards is a valuable skill indeed.

and left to wander after their original purpose has been fulfilled. Most demons have a love-hate relationship with the mortal realm. They delight in scaring, torturing, and corrupting mortals, but many have a difficult time adapt- ing to its social mores and inherent lawfulness (from their decidedly relative point of view). Rare is the demon who can live in seclusion in a mortal city for any length of time without giving in to its base desires. Only the most dis- ciplined, on a specific task for a demon lord or prince, or those specifically created to tempt mortals to wickedness (such as succubi and incubi) can remain on the Material
Plane without great psychological strain.

Eager executioners sent forth by the nalfeshnee to pass judgment on their enemies or others whom they decide deserve death, alastors roam the Abyss, evoking fear wherever they go, for most know them as merciless kill- ers armed with the support and favor of a conspiracy of wicked demons. Whether sent to track down and kill a demon who angered their masters or simply for their own amusement, alastors go where they wish, having free access to all places in the Abyss outside those dominions controlled by the demon lords and princes. When they find their victims, they single out their prey, pronounce their victims' guilt, and end their victims' existence with a single swipe of their keen scythes.

Alastors stand as tall as ogres, but have lithe, muscular frames. Spiky bone ridges cluster at their elbows, their shoulders, and the backs of their heads, erupting from their mustard-yellow skin. Their heads appear lizard-like, with bright, shining red eyes. All alastors carry enormous scythes, with which they complete their grisly work. Some also deck themselves in voluminous robes and carry hour- glasses, gavels, and other symbols of judgment.

behavior of demons, souls, and visitors from the Material
Plane alike. They then sit in judgment of violators (who most often are tried in absentia), sentencing many to hor- rific tortures or gruesome death. To the casual observer (and even some dedicated scholars), the body of law created by the Magistrate Cabal is contradictory at best, changing on what appears to be the whim of the nalfesh- nee. The laws defer to the demon princes, never seeking to limit their power or influence. Everyone else would ignore the cabal's rulings like the mad ramblings they are save for one factor: the alastors.
</p>
<p id="page104p2" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
If the nalfeshnee serve as the legislators and judges in this bizarre legal charade, alastors serve as their exe- cutioners. The cabal dispatches alastors from their lair, entrusting the creatures with carrying out whatever sen- tence it has decreed (almost always that of death). After an alastor has pronounced sentence, its chosen victim can either fight or run away. In the court of the Abyss, there are no appeals.

Their lower bodies are distended bel- lies split by prehensile tentacles. Its navel is yawning maw ringed by sharp teeth.

In rural lands in the Material Plane, some superstitious individuals create small statuettes of beautiful beings known as alrunes. They pray to these figurines, asking them for guidance and protection and sometimes hints regarding the future in exchange for clothing the statu- ettes and giving them small offerings of food and drink.
Most of the time the dolls do nothing, eventually ending up in some drawer or refuse pile. But when the individ- ual's life is threatened by a spouse, lover, or relative, the dolls sometimes send a signal to the Abyss, warning ser- vants of the demon princess Nocticula that something is amiss on the Material Plane.

On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed back 5 feet or to the side of the enveloper. A creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.
On a failed save, the enveloper enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 13 (3d8) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 26 (8d8) acid damage at the start of each of the enveloper's turns. When the enveloper moves, the engulfed creature moves with it. In addition, the engulfed creature must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or have its alignment shift one step toward chaotic evil. Each time the target's alignment shifts in this way, the enveloper gains 21 (2d20) temporary hit points that last for 24 hours. The change to the creature's alignment lasts until it finishes a long rest, though the creature can choose to make the alignment change permanent.
An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 16 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the enveloper.

Although a number of specific breeds of demons populate the Abyss, they represent but a fraction of what the chaotic evil plane creates. Many demons—some would argue most, in fact—pull themselves free of the muck, displaying a wide range of bizarre physical traits. Some possess animal features in unlikely combinations and positions across their misshapen bodies. Others might have bizarre char- acteristics and shapes, with some having enormous heads they must drag along the ground and others being heaps of slippery tentacles crowded around a slavering maw. Others still might look almost human but have some foul sign that gives away the truth about their wicked natures.
</p>
<p id="page112p33" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Rather than compartmentalizing these differing breeds into their own strains, most demonologists just refer to them as horde demons, since they gather up in large mobs and crash about the Abyss to feed their appetite for chaos and destruction. Within the ranks of horde demons, there are three basic types differentiated by size: least horde demons, lesser horde demons, and horde demons.

A jahi can hold a single soul at any one time. Once it has done so, it becomes significantly more difficult for it to operate in normal society. As the soul struggles fruitlessly to escape, it reaches for freedom so that impressions of its hands and face sometimes appear upon the jahi's belly. A jahi can disgorge the soul from its body as an action. Doing so returns the soul to its rightful place after 2d4 rounds (no matter the distance between body and soul).
Those demon princes who employ jahi as kidnappers generally have some means of trapping captured souls in small cages or gems so that they might bargain with the mortals for services.
Though they could doubtless destroy the captured souls, they gain no sustenance from doing so as they do from the annihilated souls of the chaotic evil dead.
Creatures that lack souls, naturally, are immune to a jahi's Swallow Soul attack.

<p id="page117p32" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Thaumaturges and other traffickers of demonic knowl-edge and magic have inadvertently saved the mandragoras from extinction. A weak and feeble breed of demon, they would surely have died out had they not proven so useful as familiars. Plucked from the chaotic depths of the Abyss and bound to mortal masters, they toil as helpers, spies, and, sometimes, confidants. Their morose demeanor differentiates mandragoras from the capricious and con- niving quasits with whom they compete, along with the mandragoras' boundless curiosity about the world and their environs. Their naturally inquisitive nature tends to land them in trouble, whether they court it or not.
</p>
<p id="page117p33" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
Barely a foot tall, mandragoras appear as long-limbed manikins. Mustard-colored scales cover their delicate bodies, and they boast three small horns on the tops of their heads, the central horn being a crooked protrusion of the skull itself. Each has two whiplike tails that end in barbs.

Most demons hate mandragoras, whom they consider no better than vermin. Many loudly proclaim that the diminutive creatures are some sort of natural by-product exuded by the Abyss itself. A mandragoras enjoys the same respect granted to a rat in a human city. If it's lucky, it'll survive because it is beneath the notice of those who could easily destroy it.
</p>
<p id="page118p24" lang="en" fontname="TIKGQF+ACaslonPro-Regular">
A mandragoras's tail bears a potent poison, and few have any compunctions against using it. A particularly devious mandragoras sometimes pretends to befriend a mortal, asking to hop upon its shoulder for a quick ride to a nearby destination. Once in transit, the mandrago- ras swiftly jabs its tails into its host's neck, cackling in a high-pitched voice as the mortal pitches to the ground, poisoned. Some mandragoras enjoy assuming doll forms when positioned in a treasure hoard, animating in a pack to rummage around and perhaps steal their kid- napper's possessions. They always cut through the sack on their way out, hoping against hope that they've been placed in a bag of holding and that their tear will spill the bag's contents (including the mandragoras) into the
Astral Plane.

Even a short visit to the Abyss strains sanity, such is the madness and chaos found in this vicious plane. Between vistas that defy imagination and the hideous hordes of demons that caper and gambol across the tortured land- scape, even if travelers manage to escape with their lives intact, most do so haunted by the memories of their time in the Bottomless Pit. As maddening as the plane can be, however, there are things dwelling in the Abyss that prey on the frightened and horrified, demons that profit when they shatter the minds of their victims. The mazareen are such demons, and they have no compunction against using their methods against fiends and outsiders alike.
